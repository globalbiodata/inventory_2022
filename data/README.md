## `*/combined_train_stats.csv`

The two files `classif_metrics/combined_train_stats.csv` and `ner_metrics/combined_train_stats.csv` have the same columns. They contain obtained during fine-tuning of the article classification and NER models, respectively.

### `classif_metrics/combined_train_stats.csv`

Metrics of each model were output by [src/class_train.py](../src/class_train.py), and combined by [src/combine_stats.py](../src/combine_stats.py) to generate this file.

### `ner_metrics/combined_train_stats.csv`

Metrics of each model were output by [src/ner_train.py](../src/ner_train.py), and combined by [src/combine_stats.py](../src/combine_stats.py) to generate this file.

### Columns of both files:

* **epoch**: Training epoch, beginning at 0 and going to 9 (10 epochs)
* **train_precision**: Precision on training set
* **train_recall**: Recall on training set
* **train_f1**: *F*1-score on training set
* **train_loss**: Loss on training set
* **val_precision**: Precision on validation set
* **val_recall**: Recall on validation set
* **val_f1**: *F*1-score on validation set
* **val_loss**: Loss on validation set
* **model_name**: Model name (corresponding to the **model** column of [config/models_info.tsv](../config/models_info.tsv))

## `*/combined_test_stats`

The two files `classif_metrics/combined_test_stats.csv` and `ner_metrics/combined_test_stats.csv` have the same columns. They contain obtained during evaluation on the witheld test set of the article classification and NER models, respectively.

### `classif_metrics/combined_test_stats.csv`

Metrics of each model were output by [src/class_final_eval.py](../src/class_final_eval.py), and combined by [src/combine_stats.py](../src/combine_stats.py) to generate this file.

### `ner_metrics/combined_test_stats.csv`

Metrics of each model were output by [src/ner_final_eval.py](../src/ner_final_eval.py), and combined by [src/combine_stats.py](../src/combine_stats.py) to generate this file.

### Columns of both files:

* **model**: Model name (corresponding to the **model** column of [config/models_info.tsv](../config/models_info.tsv))
* **precision**: Precision on test set
* **recall**: Recall on test set
* **f1**: *F*1-score on test set
* **loss**: Loss on test set

## `epmc_query_results_2022.csv`

EuropePMC query results that were used for generation of the inventory in 2022. The following columns are included:

* **id**: article id
* **title**: article title
* **abstract**: article abstract
* **publication_date**: article first publication date

## `final_inventory_2022.csv`

The final output file of the inventory conducted in 2022.

Information on the contents of this file are available in the [main README](../README.md#final-inventory-output).

## `manual_classifications.csv`

This file contains the manual classifications of 1634 articles by kes (Kenneth Schackart) and hji (Heidi Imker). This set was split into training, validation, and testing splits for fine-tuning and evaluation of the article classification models.

* **id**: article id
* **title**: article title
* **abstract**: article abstract
* **checked_by**: curator initials
* **kes_check**: kes determination where 0 = not an article describing data resource OR 1 = an article describing data resource
* **hji_check**: hji determination where 0 = not an article describing data resource OR 1 = an article describing data resource
* **curation_sum**: sum of curator values (iii_checks)
* **number_of_checks**: number of checks (by different curators)
* **curation_score**: curation_sum/number_of_checks (gives a "confidence score"" as done in Wren 2017); note that value other than 0 or 1 indiciate lack of agreement between curators
* **kes_notes**: raw notes documented by kes
* **hji_notes**: raw notes documented by hji

## `manual_ner_extraction.csv`

The file contains the manual NER extraction from articles manually classifiedf to describe a biodata resource. Curation was performed by Kenneth Schackart, and validated by Heidi Imker.

* **id**: article id
* **title**: article title. Adjacent articles were not included (*e.g.* "Protein Ensemble Database" not "The Protein Ensemble Database").
* **abstract**: article abstract
* **name**: resource name
* **acronym**: resource acronym or shortened name, as presented in the title or abstract. This is sometimes the same as **name**.
* **url**: resource URL. Note, other URL's may have been present that were not that of the resource. These extraneous URL's were not extracted into this column.
* **short_description**: short description of the resource, as found in the abstract or title

**Notes**:

Version numbers were generally not included in **name** or **acronym** if there was white space between the element and version number (*e.g.* "CTDB" was recorded for "CTDB (v2.0)" while version number in "PDB-2-PBv3.0" was kept).

Many articles had several of the above elements. This could be for a few reasons:

* Multiple versions of an element, for instance when there are different **short_description**s in the title and abstract.
* Differences in case (*e.g.* "Human transporter database" vs "Human Transporter Database"). These are equivalent when case-insensitive, but case is deliberate in many titles.

## `manually_reviewed_inventory.csv`

After initial generation of the inventory, automated deduplication, and flagging for selective manual reivew, the inventory was manually reviewed by hji. This is the file resulting from that review.

For reproducing the original results of the 2022 inventory, this file can be used for the second half of the pipeline (processingt he manual review, data analysis and figures, *etc*.)
