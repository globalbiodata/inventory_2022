28791657,MEGALEX: A megastudy of visual and auditory word recognition.,"Using the megastudy approach, we report a new database (MEGALEX) of visual and auditory lexical decision times and accuracy rates for tens of thousands of words. We collected visual lexical decision data for 28,466 French words and the same number of pseudowords, and auditory lexical decision data for 17,876 French words and the same number of pseudowords (synthesized tokens were used for the auditory modality). This constitutes the first large-scale database for auditory lexical decision, and the first database to enable a direct comparison of word recognition in different modalities. Different regression analyses were conducted to illustrate potential ways to exploit this megastudy database. First, we compared the proportions of variance accounted for by five word frequency measures. Second, we conducted item-level regression analyses to examine the relative importance of the lexical variables influencing performance in the different modalities (visual and auditory). Finally, we compared the similarities and differences between the two modalities. All data are freely available on our website ( https://sedufau.shinyapps.io/megalex/ ) and are searchable at www.lexique.org , inside the Open Lexique search engine.","hji,kes",1,0,1,2,0.5,visual and lexical db,not life sci
28917032,CFS MATLAB toolbox: An experiment builder for continuous flash suppression (CFS) task.,"CFS toolbox is an open-source collection of MATLAB functions that utilizes PsychToolbox-3 (PTB-3). It is designed to allow a researcher to create and run continuous flash suppression experiments using a variety of experimental parameters (i.e., stimulus types and locations, noise characteristics, and experiment window settings). In a CFS experiment, one of the eyes at a time is presented with a dynamically changing noise pattern, while the other eye is concurrently presented with a static target stimulus, such as a Gabor patch. Due to the strong interocular suppression created by the dominant noise pattern mask, the target stimulus is rendered invisible for an extended duration. Very little knowledge of MATLAB is required for using the toolbox; experiments are generated by modifying csv files with the required parameters, and result data are output to text files for further analysis. The open-source code is available on the project page under a Creative Commons License ( http://www.mikkonuutinen.arkku.net/CFS_toolbox/ and https://bitbucket.org/mikkonuutinen/cfs_toolbox ).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

29036410,SPRINT: an SNP-free toolkit for identifying RNA editing sites.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>RNA editing generates post-transcriptional sequence alterations. Detection of RNA editing sites (RESs) typically requires the filtering of SNVs called from RNA-seq data using an SNP database, an obstacle that is difficult to overcome for most organisms.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a novel method named SPRINT that identifies RESs without the need to filter out SNPs. SPRINT also integrates the detection of hyper RESs from remapped reads, and has been fully automated to any RNA-seq data with reference genome sequence available. We have rigorously validated SPRINT's effectiveness in detecting RESs using RNA-seq data of samples in which genes encoding RNA editing enzymes are knock down or over-expressed, and have also demonstrated its superiority over current methods. We have applied SPRINT to investigate RNA editing across tissues and species, and also in the development of mouse embryonic central nervous system. A web resource (http://sprint.tianlab.cn) of RESs identified by SPRINT has been constructed.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software and related data are available at http://sprint.tianlab.cn.<h4>Contact</h4>weidong.tian@fudan.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

29539190,"MSeqDR mvTool: A mitochondrial DNA Web and API resource for comprehensive variant annotation, universal nomenclature collation, and reference genome conversion.","Accurate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant annotation is essential for the clinical diagnosis of diverse human diseases. Substantial challenges to this process include the inconsistency in mtDNA nomenclatures, the existence of multiple reference genomes, and a lack of reference population frequency data. Clinicians need a simple bioinformatics tool that is user-friendly, and bioinformaticians need a powerful informatics resource for programmatic usage. Here, we report the development and functionality of the MSeqDR mtDNA Variant Tool set (mvTool), a one-stop mtDNA variant annotation and analysis Web service. mvTool is built upon the MSeqDR infrastructure (https://mseqdr.org), with contributions of expert curated data from MITOMAP (https://www.mitomap.org) and HmtDB (https://www.hmtdb.uniba.it/hmdb). mvTool supports all mtDNA nomenclatures, converts variants to standard rCRS- and HGVS-based nomenclatures, and annotates novel mtDNA variants. Besides generic annotations from dbNSFP and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), mvTool provides allele frequencies in more than 47,000 germline mitogenomes, and disease and pathogenicity classifications from MSeqDR, Mitomap, HmtDB and ClinVar (Landrum et al., 2013). mvTools also provides mtDNA somatic variants annotations. ""mvTool API"" is implemented for programmatic access using inputs in VCF, HGVS, or classical mtDNA variant nomenclatures.

29718411,BUSCA: an integrative web server to predict subcellular localization of proteins.,"Here, we present BUSCA (http://busca.biocomp.unibo.it), a novel web server that integrates different computational tools for predicting protein subcellular localization. BUSCA combines methods for identifying signal and transit peptides (DeepSig and TPpred3), GPI-anchors (PredGPI) and transmembrane domains (ENSEMBLE3.0 and BetAware) with tools for discriminating subcellular localization of both globular and membrane proteins (BaCelLo, MemLoci and SChloro). Outcomes from the different tools are processed and integrated for annotating subcellular localization of both eukaryotic and bacterial protein sequences. We benchmark BUSCA against protein targets derived from recent CAFA experiments and other specific data sets, reporting performance at the state-of-the-art. BUSCA scores better than all other evaluated methods on 2732 targets from CAFA2, with a F1 value equal to 0.49 and among the best methods when predicting targets from CAFA3. We propose BUSCA as an integrated and accurate resource for the annotation of protein subcellular localization.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,0,
29721311,Gene Unprediction with Spurio: A tool to identify spurious protein sequences.,"We now have access to the sequences of tens of millions of proteins. These protein sequences are essential for modern molecular biology and computational biology. The vast majority of protein sequences are derived from gene prediction tools and have no experimental supporting evidence for their translation.  Despite the increasing accuracy of gene prediction tools there likely exists a large number of spurious protein predictions in the sequence databases.  We have developed the Spurio tool to help identify spurious protein predictions in prokaryotes.  Spurio searches the query protein sequence against a prokaryotic nucleotide database using tblastn and identifies homologous sequences. The tblastn matches are used to score the query sequence's likelihood of being a spurious protein prediction using a Gaussian process model. The most informative feature is the appearance of stop codons within the presumed translation of homologous DNA sequences. Benchmarking shows that the Spurio tool is able to distinguish spurious from true proteins. However, transposon proteins are prone to be predicted as spurious because of the frequency of degraded homologs found in the DNA sequence databases. Our initial experiments suggest that less than 1% of the proteins in the UniProtKB sequence database are likely to be spurious and that Spurio is able to identify over 60 times more spurious proteins than the AntiFam resource.

30222561,Large-Scale Study of Perceptual Video Quality.,"The great variations of videographic skills in videography, camera designs, compression and processing protocols, communication and bandwidth environments, and displays leads to an enormous variety of video impairments. Current noreference (NR) video quality models are unable to handle this diversity of distortions. This is true in part because available video quality assessment databases contain very limited content, fixed resolutions, were captured using a small number of camera devices by a few videographers and have been subjected to a modest number of distortions. As such, these databases fail to adequately represent real world videos, which contain very different kinds of content obtained under highly diverse imaging conditions and are subject to authentic, complex and often commingled distortions that are difficult or impossible to simulate. As a result, NR video quality predictors tested on real-world video data often perform poorly. Towards advancing NR video quality prediction, we have constructed a largescale video quality assessment database containing 585 videos of unique content, captured by a large number of users, with wide ranges of levels of complex, authentic distortions. We collected a large number of subjective video quality scores via crowdsourcing. A total of 4776 unique participants took part in the study, yielding more than 205000 opinion scores, resulting in an average of 240 recorded human opinions per video. We demonstrate the value of the new resource, which we call the LIVE Video Quality Challenge Database (LIVE-VQC for short), by conducting a comparison of leading NR video quality predictors on it. This study is the largest video quality assessment study ever conducted along several key dimensions: number of unique contents, capture devices, distortion types and combinations of distortions, study participants, and recorded subjective scores.

30261835,Sequence homology in eukaryotes (SHOE): interactive visual tool for promoter analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microarray and DNA-sequencing based technologies continue to produce enormous amounts of data on gene expression. This data has great potential to illuminate our understanding of biology and medicine, but the data alone is of limited value without computational tools to allow human investigators to visualize and interpret it in the context of their problem of interest.<h4>Results</h4>We created a web server called SHOE that provides an interactive, visual presentation of the available evidence of transcriptional regulation and gene co-expression to facilitate its exploration and interpretation. SHOE predicts the likely transcription factor binding sites in orthologous promoters of humans, mice, and rats using the combined information of 1) transcription factor binding preferences (position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) libraries such as Transfac32, Jaspar, HOCOMOCO, ChIP-seq, SELEX, PBM, and iPS-reprogramming factor), 2) evolutionary conservation of putative binding sites in orthologous promoters, and 3) co-expression tendencies of gene pairs based on 1,714 normal human cells selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus Database.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SHOE enables users to explore potential interactions between transcription factors and target genes via multiple data views, discover transcription factor binding motifs on top of gene co-expression, and visualize genes as a network of gene and transcription factors on its native gadget GeneViz, the CellDesigner pathway analyzer, and the Reactome database to search the pathways involved. As we demonstrate here when using the CREB1 and Nf-Œ∫B datasets, SHOE can reliably identify experimentally verified interactions and predict plausible novel ones, yielding new biological insights into the gene regulatory mechanisms involved. SHOE comes with a manual describing how to run it on a local PC or via the Garuda platform ( www.garuda-alliance.org ), where it joins other popular gadgets such as the CellDesigner pathway analyzer and the Reactome database, as part of analysis workflows to meet the growing needs of molecular biologists and medical researchers.

31106379,Drug ReposER: a web server for predicting similar amino acid arrangements to known drug binding interfaces for potential drug repositioning.,"A common drug repositioning strategy is the re-application of an existing drug to address alternative targets. A crucial aspect to enable such repurposing is that the drug's binding site on the original target is similar to that on the alternative target. Based on the assumption that proteins with similar binding sites may bind to similar drugs, the 3D substructure similarity data can be used to identify similar sites in other proteins that are not known targets. The Drug ReposER (DRug REPOSitioning Exploration Resource) web server is designed to identify potential targets for drug repurposing based on sub-structural similarity to the binding interfaces of known drug binding sites. The application has pre-computed amino acid arrangements from protein structures in the Protein Data Bank that are similar to the 3D arrangements of known drug binding sites thus allowing users to explore them as alternative targets. Users can annotate new structures for sites that are similarly arranged to the residues found in known drug binding interfaces.

Specifically, BEERE first aims to help users examine the credibility of known entity-to-entity associative or semantic relationships supported by database or literature references from the user input of a gene/term list. Then, it will help users uncover the relative importance of each entity-a gene or a term-within the user input by computing the ranking scores of all entities. At last, it will help users hypothesize new gene functions or genotype-phenotype associations by an interactive visual interface of constructed global entity relationship network. The output from BEERE includes: a list of the original entities matched with known relationships in databases; any expanded entities that may be generated from the analysis; the ranks and ranking scores reported with statistical significance for each entity; and an interactive graphical display of the gene or term network within data provenance annotations that link to external data sources.

31165321,I-PINE web server: an integrative probabilistic NMR assignment system for proteins.,"Various methods for understanding the structural and dynamic properties of proteins rely on the analysis of their NMR chemical shifts. These methods require the initial assignment of NMR signals to particular atoms in the sequence of the protein, a step that can be very time-consuming. The probabilistic interaction network of evidence (PINE) algorithm for automated assignment of backbone and side chain chemical shifts utilizes a Bayesian probabilistic network model that analyzes sequence data and peak lists from multiple NMR experiments. PINE, which is one of the most popular and reliable automated chemical shift assignment algorithms, has been available to the protein NMR community for longer than a decade. We announce here a new web server version of PINE, called Integrative PINE (I-PINE), which supports more types of NMR experiments than PINE (including three-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement and four-dimensional J-coupling experiments) along with more comprehensive visualization of chemical shift based analysis of protein structure and dynamics. The I-PINE server is freely accessible at http://i-pine.nmrfam.wisc.edu . Help pages and tutorial including browser capability are available at: http://i-pine.nmrfam.wisc.edu/instruction.html .

31220119,Interlaboratory study to validate a STR profiling method for intraspecies identification of mouse cell lines.,"The Consortium for Mouse Cell Line Authentication was formed to validate Short Tandem Repeat (STR) markers for intraspecies identification of mouse cell lines. The STR profiling method is a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay comprised of primers targeting 19 mouse STR markers and two human STR markers (for interspecies contamination screening). The goals of the Consortium were to perform an interlaboratory study to-(1) validate the mouse STR markers to uniquely identify mouse cell lines (intraspecies identification), (2) to provide a public database of mouse cell lines with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-validated mouse STR profiles, and (3) to publish the results of the interlaboratory study. The interlaboratory study was an international effort that consisted of 12 participating laboratories representing institutions from academia, industry, biological resource centers, and government. The study was based on 50 of the most commonly used mouse cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Of the 50 mouse cell lines, 18 had unique STR profiles that were 100% concordant (match) among all Consortium laboratory members, and the remaining 32 cell lines had discordance that was resolved readily and led to improvement of the assay. The discordance was due to low signal and interpretation issues involving artifacts and genotyping errors. Although the total number of discordant STR profiles was relatively high in this study, the percent of labs agreeing on allele calls among the discordant samples was above 92%. The STR profiles, including electropherogram images, for NIST-validated mouse cell lines will be published on the NCBI BioSample Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/). Overall, the interlaboratory study showed that the multiplex PCR method using 18 of the 19 mouse STR markers is capable of discriminating at the intraspecies level between mouse cell lines. Further studies are ongoing to refine the assay including (1) development of an allelic ladder for improving the accuracy of allele calling and (2) integration of stutter filters to identify true stutter.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descriptive of resource
31318409,PTM-Logo: a program for generation of sequence logos based on position-specific background amino-acid probabilities.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Identification of the amino-acid motifs in proteins that are targeted for post-translational modifications (PTMs) is of great importance in understanding regulatory networks. Information about targeted motifs can be derived from mass spectrometry data that identify peptides containing specific PTMs such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and acetylation. Comparison of input data against a standardized 'background' set allows identification of over- and under-represented amino acids surrounding the modified site. Conventionally, calculation of targeted motifs assumes a random background distribution of amino acids surrounding the modified position. However, we show that probabilities of amino acids depend on (i) the type of the modification and (ii) their positions relative to the modified site. Thus, software that identifies such over- and under-represented amino acids should make appropriate adjustments for these effects. Here we present a new program, PTM-Logo, that generates representations of these amino acid preferences ('logos') based on position-specific amino-acid probability backgrounds calculated either from user-input data or curated databases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PTM-Logo is freely available online at http://sysbio.chula.ac.th/PTMLogo/ or https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/PTMLogo/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

Here, we present a webtool called ViVa (Visualizing Variation) which aims to empower any researcher to take advantage of the amazing genetic resource collected in the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 1001 Genomes Project (http://1001genomes.org). ViVa facilitates data mining on the gene, gene family, or gene network level. To test the utility and accessibility of ViVa, we assembled a team with a range of expertise within biology and bioinformatics to analyze the natural variation within the well-studied nuclear auxin signaling pathway. Our analysis has provided further confirmation of existing knowledge and has also helped generate new hypotheses regarding this well-studied pathway. These results highlight how natural variation could be used to generate and test hypotheses about less-studied gene families and networks, especially when paired with biochemical and genetic characterization. ViVa is also readily extensible to databases of interspecific genetic variation in plants as well as other organisms, such as the 3,000 Rice Genomes Project ( http://snp-seek.irri.org/) and human genetic variation ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,a tool and not descriptive of resource

To prevent it, researchers are expected to frequently test the authenticity of the cell lines they are working on. STR profiling was selected as the international reference method to perform cell line authentication. While the experimental protocols and manipulations for generating a STR profile are well described, the available tools and workflows to analyze such data are lacking. The Cellosaurus knowledge resource aimed to improve the situation by compiling all the publicly available STR profiles from the literature and other databases. As a result, it grew to become the largest database in terms of human STR profiles, with 6,474 distinct cell lines having an associated STR profile (release July 31, 2019). Here we present CLASTR, the Cellosaurus STR similarity search tool enabling users to compare one or more STR profiles with those available in the Cellosaurus cell line knowledge resource. It aims to help researchers in the process of cell line authentication by providing numerous functionalities.

Photosynthetic organisms, and plants especially, have established complex programs that coordinate physiological, metabolic and developmental processes with the changing light. The diurnal regulation of the underlying transcriptional processes is observed when groups of functionally related genes (gene modules) are expressed at a specific time of the day. However, studying the diurnal regulation of these gene modules in the plant kingdom was hampered by the large amount of data required for the analyses. To meet this need, we used gene expression data from 17 diurnal studies spanning the whole Archaeplastida kingdom (Plantae kingdom in the broad sense) to make an online diurnal database. We have equipped the database with tools that allow user-friendly cross-species comparisons of gene expression profiles, entire co-expression networks, co-expressed clusters (involved in specific biological processes), time-specific gene expression and others. We exemplify how these tools can be used by studying three important biological questions: (i) the evolution of cell division, (ii) the diurnal control of gene modules in algae and (iii) the conservation of diurnally controlled modules across species.

We present a dataset integrating DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of antenatal hypoxia affecting rat fetal and adult offspring hearts to understand hypoxia-mediated epigenomic reprogramming of the heart development. We showed that antenatal hypoxia not only induced DNA methylomic and transcriptomic changes in the fetal hearts, but also had a delayed and lasting effect on the adult offspring hearts. Of interest, antenatal hypoxia induced opposite changes in DNA methylation patterns in fetal and adult hearts, with a hypermethylation in the fetus and a hypomethylation in the adult. An extensive preprocessing, quality assessment, and downstream data analyses were performed on the genomic dataset so that the research community may take advantage of the public resource. These dataset could be exploited as a comprehensive resource for understanding fetal hypoxia-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in the heart development and further developmental programming of heart vulnerability to disease later in life.Figshare doi: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9948572.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The candidate pathways identified from C. elegans study were also confirmed using vertebrate model, zebrafish, Danio rerio and human relevance was then inferred using Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) analysis. Prior to evaluating the toxicity, label-free Raman mapping was conducted to investigate whether or not the organisms could uptake HDPE. C. elegans transcription factor RNAi screening results showed that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Œ≤) signaling pathways were significantly associated with HDPE exposure, which was also confirmed in zebrafish model. Gene-disease interaction analysis using the CTD revealed the possible human health implications of microplastics.

Significant efforts have been made to curate gene:disease associations both in academic research and commercial genetic testing laboratory settings. However, many of these valuable resources exist as islands and must be used independently, generating static, single-resource gene:disease association lists. Here we describe genepanel.iobio (https://genepanel.iobio.io) an easy to use, free and open-source web tool for generating disease- and phenotype-associated gene lists from multiple gene:disease association resources, including the NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), Phenolyzer, and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We demonstrate the utility of genepanel.iobio by applying it to complex, rare and undiagnosed disease cases that had reached a diagnostic conclusion. We find that genepanel.iobio is able to correctly prioritize the gene containing the diagnostic variant in roughly half of these challenging cases. Importantly, each component resource contributed diagnostic value, showing the benefits of this aggregate approach. We expect genepanel.iobio will improve the ease and diagnostic value of generating gene:disease association lists for genetic test ordering and whole genome or exome sequencing variant prioritization.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

32022785,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Asparaginase: Intra-individual Variability and Predictivity in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated With PEG-Asparaginase in the AIEOP-BFM Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 2009 Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can identify patients with subtherapeutic asparaginase (ASNase) activity [silent inactivation (SI)] and prospectively guide therapeutic adaptation. However, limited intra-individual variability is a precondition for targeted dosing and the diagnosis of SI.<h4>Methods</h4>In the AIEOP-BFM acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 2009 trial, 2771 children with ALL were included and underwent ASNase-TDM in a central laboratory in M√ºnster. Two biweekly administrations of pegylated ASNase during induction and a third dose during reinduction or the high-risk block, which was administered several weeks later, were monitored. We calculated (1) the incidence of SI; and (2) the predictivity of SI for SI after the subsequent administration. ASNase activities monitored during induction were categorized into percentiles at the respective sampling time points. These percentiles were used to calculate the intra-individual range of percentiles as a surrogate for intrapatient variability and to evaluate the predictivity of ASNase activity for the subsequent administration.<h4>Results</h4>The overall incidence of SI was low (4.9%). The positive predictive value of SI identified by one sample was ‚â§21%. Confirmation of SI by a second sample indicated a high positive predictive value of 100% for biweekly administrations, but not for administration more than 17 weeks later. Sampling and/or documentation errors were risks for misdiagnosis of SI. High intra-individual variability in ASNase activities, with ranges of percentiles over more than 2 quartiles and low predictivity, was observed in approximately 25% of the patients. These patients were likely to fail dose individualization based on TDM data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To use TDM as a basis for clinical decisions, standardized clinical procedures are required and high intra-individual variability should be taken into account.

32058000,TbCAPs: A toolbox for co-activation pattern analysis.,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging provides rich spatio-temporal data of human brain activity during task and rest. Many recent efforts have focussed on characterising dynamics of brain activity. One notable instance is co-activation pattern (CAP) analysis, a frame-wise analytical approach that disentangles the different functional brain networks interacting with a user-defined seed region. While promising applications in various clinical settings have been demonstrated, there is not yet any centralised, publicly accessible resource to facilitate the deployment of the technique. Here, we release a working version of TbCAPs, a new toolbox for CAP analysis, which includes all steps of the analytical pipeline, introduces new methodological developments that build on already existing concepts, and enables a facilitated inspection of CAPs and resulting metrics of brain dynamics. The toolbox is available on a public academic repository at https://c4science.ch/source/CAP_Toolbox.git. In addition, to illustrate the feasibility and usefulness of our pipeline, we describe an application to the study of human cognition. CAPs are constructed from resting-state fMRI using as seed the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and, in a separate sample, we successfully predict a behavioural measure of continuous attentional performance from the metrics of CAP dynamics (R ‚Äã= ‚Äã0.59).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,a little questionable as life sci too

The cultural institutions were positive about the interdisciplinary collaboration with the Center for Mental Health and benefited from working with groups of people with mental health problems. They considered the collaboration to have encouraged skills development by working with groups that they did not regularly engaged with. If cultural institutions are to engage with the mental health wellbeing agenda then policy-driven initiatives can support collaborations that involve groups of people with mental health problems.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not life sci
32154836,iATC-FRAKEL: a simple multi-label web server for recognizing anatomical therapeutic chemical classes of drugs with their fingerprints only.,"MOTIVATION:Anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system is very important for drug utilization and studies. Correct prediction of the 14 classes in the first level for given drugs is an essential problem for the study on such system. Several multi-label classifiers have been proposed in this regard. However, only two of them provided the web servers and their performance was not very high. On the other hand, although some rest classifiers can provide better performance, they were built based on some prior knowledge on drugs, such as information of chemical-chemical interaction and chemical ontology, leading to limited applications. Furthermore, provided codes of these classifiers are almost inaccessible for pharmacologists. RESULTS:In this study, we built a simple web server, namely iATC-FRAKEL. This web server only required the SMILES format of drugs as input and extracted their fingerprints for making prediction. The performance of the iATC-FRAKEL was much higher than all existing web servers and was comparable to the best multi-label classifier but had much wider applications.

32241255,EpiMOLAS: an intuitive web-based framework for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>DNA methylation is a crucial epigenomic mechanism in various biological processes. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology, methylated cytosine sites can be revealed at the single nucleotide level. However, the WGBS data analysis process is usually complicated and challenging.<h4>Results</h4>To alleviate the associated difficulties, we integrated the WGBS data processing steps and downstream analysis into a two-phase approach. First, we set up the required tools in Galaxy and developed workflows to calculate the methylation level from raw WGBS data and generate a methylation status summary, the mtable. This computation environment is wrapped into the Docker container image DocMethyl, which allows users to rapidly deploy an executable environment without tedious software installation and library dependency problems. Next, the mtable files were uploaded to the web server EpiMOLAS_web to link with the gene annotation databases that enable rapid data retrieval and analyses.<h4>Conclusion</h4>To our knowledge, the EpiMOLAS framework, consisting of DocMethyl and EpiMOLAS_web, is the first approach to include containerization technology and a web-based system for WGBS data analysis from raw data processing to downstream analysis.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as genes that appeared at least three times with p values <0.05 and a fold change of ‚â•50% (|log2FC| ‚â• 0.58). Hub genes were identified by evaluating the following parameters using a protein-protein interaction network: node degrees, betweenness, and eigenfactor scores. Hub genes and the top-40 DEGs by |log2FC| were used to generate a Venn diagram, and key genes were identified. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Information on ovarian cancer patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed, and the effect of topotecan on the protein expression was examined by Western blotting.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven topotecan signatures were downloaded, and 65 upregulated and 87 downregulated DEGs were identified. Twenty-one hub genes were identified. We identified eight key genes as upregulated genes, including NFKBIA, IKBKB, GADD45A, CDKN1A, and HIST2H2BE, while EZH2, CDC20, and CDK7 were identified as downregulated genes, which play critical roles in the cell cycle and carcinogenesis in KEGG analysis. In the TCGA analysis, the CDKN1A+/EZH2- group had the longest median survival, while the CDKN1A-/EZH2+ group had the shortest median survival. Topotecan-treated murine ovarian (MOSEC), colorectal (CT26), and lung (LLC) cancer cell lines displayed upregulated CDKN1A encoding p21 and downregulated Ezh2.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using publicly accessible bioinformatics tools, we evaluated key genes and pathways related to topotecan and examined the key genes using the TCGA database and in vitro studies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descriptive of resource
32270255,Major depressive disorder and cardiometabolic diseases: a bidirectional Mendelian randomisation study.,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS:Observational studies have shown a bidirectional association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiometabolic diseases. We conducted a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to assess the causal associations of MDD with type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure and vice versa. METHODS:We extracted summary-level data for MDD, type 2 diabetes, CAD and heart failure from corresponding published large genome-wide association studies of individuals mainly of European-descent. In total, 96 SNPs for MDD, 202 SNPs for type 2 diabetes, 44 SNPs for CAD and 12 SNPs for heart failure were proposed as instrumental variables at the genome-wide significance level (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-8). The random-effects inverse-variance weighted method was used for the main analyses. RESULTS:Genetic liability to MDD was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes and CAD at the Bonferroni-corrected significance level. The ORs of type 2 diabetes and CAD were respectively 1.26 (95% CI 1.10, 1.43; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ6‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-4) and 1.16 (95% CI 1.05, 1.29; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0047) per one-unit increase in loge odds of MDD. There was a suggestive association between MDD and heart failure (OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.01, 1.21]; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.033). We found limited evidence supporting causal effects of cardiometabolic diseases on MDD risk in the reverse MR analyses. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:The present study strengthened the evidence that MDD is a potential risk factor for type 2 diabetes and CAD. Whether MDD is causally related to heart failure needs further study.

The initial release of rMAPS focused only on the most common alternative splicing event, skipped exon or exon skipping. However, there was a high demand for the analysis of other major types of alternative splicing events, especially for retained intron events since this is the most common type of alternative splicing in plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we expanded the implementation of rMAPS2 to facilitate analyses for all five major types of alternative splicing events: skipped exon, mutually exclusive exons, alternative 5' splice site, alternative 3' splice site and retained intron. In addition, by employing multi-threading, rMAPS2 has vastly improved the user experience with significant reductions in running time, ‚àº3.5 min for the analysis of all five major alternative splicing types at once.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

However, there are scarce data regarding best practices for return of results and clinical application of actionable genetic findings for kidney patients.<h4>Design, setting, participants, & measurements</h4>We developed a return of results workflow in collaborations with clinicians for the retrospective recontact of adult nephrology patients who had been recruited into a biobank research study for exome sequencing and were identified to have medically actionable genetic findings.<h4>Results</h4>Using this workflow, we attempted to recontact a diverse pilot cohort of 104 nephrology research participants with actionable genetic findings, encompassing 34 different monogenic etiologies of nephropathy and five single-gene disorders recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for return as medically actionable secondary findings. We successfully recontacted 64 (62%) participants and returned results to 41 (39%) individuals. In each case, the genetic diagnosis had meaningful implications for the patients' nephrology care. Through implementation efforts and qualitative interviews with providers, we identified over 20 key challenges associated with returning results to study participants, and found that physician knowledge gaps in genomics was a recurrent theme. We iteratively addressed these challenges to yield an optimized workflow, which included standardized consultation notes with tailored management recommendations, monthly educational conferences on core topics in genomics, and a curated list of expert clinicians for patients requiring extranephrologic referrals.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Developing the infrastructure to support return of genetic results in nephrology was resource-intensive, but presented potential opportunities for improving patient care.<h4>Podcast</h4>This article contains a podcast at https://www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2020_04_16_12481019.mp3.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,podcast
32312909,Optimizing Resources in Children's Surgical Care: An Update on the American College of Surgeons' Verification Program.,"Surgical procedures are performed in the United States in a wide variety of clinical settings and with variation in clinical outcomes. In May 2012, the Task Force for Children's Surgical Care, an ad hoc multidisciplinary group comprising physicians representing specialties relevant to pediatric perioperative care, was convened to generate recommendations to optimize the delivery of children's surgical care. This group generated a white paper detailing the consensus opinions of the involved experts. Following these initial recommendations, the American College of Surgeons (ACS), Children's Hospital Association, and Task Force for Children's Surgical Care, with input from all related perioperative specialties, developed and published specific and detailed resource and quality standards designed to improve children's surgical care (https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/childrens-surgery/childrens-surgery-verification). In 2015, with the endorsement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/135/6/e1538), the ACS established a pilot verification program. In January 2017, after completion of the pilot program, the ACS Children's Surgery Verification Quality Improvement Program was officially launched. Verified sites are listed on the program Web site at https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/childrens-surgery/childrens-surgery-verification/centers, and more than 150 are interested in verification.

32343964,Longitudinal Competence Programs for Basic Point-of-Care Ultrasound in Critical Care: A Systematic Review.,"<h4>Background</h4>Competence in point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) is widely recommended by several critical care societies. Despite numerous introductory short courses, very few doctors attain PoCUS competence because of the challenges in establishing longitudinal competence programs.<h4>Research question</h4>To evaluate the methodologic quality of the literature on basic PoCUS competence processes in critical care.<h4>Study design and methods</h4>A systematic review to identify manuscripts meeting predefined inclusion criteria was performed using three medical databases (PubMed, OVID Embase, and Web of Science); using extra references from original articles, review articles, and expert panel guidelines; and by directly contacting authors for further information if required. The objectives, domains, and inclusion and exclusion criteria of the review were determined during discussions between experienced PoCUS educators. Data extraction and analyses were performed independently by three reviewers.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 5,408 abstracts extracted, 42 met the inclusion criteria for longitudinal PoCUS competence. Each study was described along four broad categories: general information, study design, and trainee characteristics; description of introductory course; description of longitudinal competence program; and grading of overall methodologic quality on a 4-point Likert scale. Thirty-nine studies (92.9%) were from a single center. Most studies lacked important details on study methodology such as prior ultrasound experience, pre- and postcourse tests, models for hands-on sessions, ratio of instructors to trainees, competence assessment criteria, number of scans performed by individual trainees, and formative and summative assessments. The studies were rated as follows: poor = 19 (45.2%), average = 15 (35.7%), good = 4 (9.5%), and excellent = 4 (9.5%).<h4>Interpretation</h4>Ther is very little high-quality evidence on PoCUS competence. To help frame policy guidelines to improve PoCUS education, there is a need for well-designed longitudinal studies on PoCUS competence.<h4>Trial registry</h4>PROSPERO database; No.: CRD42018094033; URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32347334,Retrograde intrarenal surgery of renal stones: a critical multi-aspect evaluation of the outcomes by the Turkish Academy of Urology Prospective Study Group (ACUP Study).,"<h4>Aims</h4>To outline and evaluate the incidence, management and follow-up of the residual fragments (RFs) following retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) of renal stones by the Turkish Academy of Urology Prospective Study Group (ACUP Study).<h4>Methods</h4>Following the ethical committee approval, 15 centers providing data regarding the incidence, management, and follow-up of RFs after RIRS were included and all relevant information was recorded into the same electronic database program ( https://acup.uroturk.org.tr/ ) created by Turkish Urology Academy for Residual Stone Study.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1112 cases underwent RIRS for renal calculi and RFs were observed in 276 cases (24.8%). Of all the parameters evaluated, our results demonstrated no statistically significant relation between preoperative DJ stenting and the presence of RFs (œá2 (1)‚Äâ=‚Äâ158.418; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.099). RFs were significantly higher in patients treated with UAS (82 patients, 29.3%) during the procedure compared to the cases who did not receive UAS (194 patients, 23.3%) (œá2 (1)‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.999; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.046). The mean period for a secondary intervention after RIRS was 28.39 (¬±‚Äâ12.52) days. Regarding the procedures applied for RF removal, re-RIRS was the most commonly performed approach (56%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the reported safe and successful outcomes, the incidence of RFs is higher, after the RIRS procedure particularly in cases with relatively larger calculi. Such cases need to be followed in a close manner and although a second flexible ureteroscopy is the treatment of choice for fragment removal in the majority of these patients, shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy may also be preferred in selected cases.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,clinical; not descriptive of resource
32363380,CeRNASeek: an R package for identification and analysis of ceRNA regulation.,"Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) represents a novel layer of gene regulation that controls both physiological and pathological processes. However, there is still lack of computational tools for quickly identifying ceRNA regulation. To address this problem, we presented an R-package, CeRNASeek, which allows identifying and analyzing ceRNA-ceRNA interactions by integration of multiple-omics data. CeRNASeek integrates six widely used computational methods to identify ceRNA-ceRNA interactions, including two global and four context-specific ceRNA regulation prediction methods. In addition, it provides several downstream analyses for predicted ceRNA-ceRNA pairs, including regulatory network analysis, functional annotation and survival analysis. With examples of cancer-related ceRNA prioritization and cancer subtyping, we demonstrate that CeRNASeek is a valuable tool for investigating the function of ceRNAs in complex diseases. In summary, CeRNASeek provides a comprehensive and efficient tool for identifying and analysis of ceRNA regulation. The package is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CeRNASeek.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
32367143,"Not just a research method: If used with caution, can job-exposure matrices be a useful tool in the practice of occupational medicine and public health?","The recent editorial by Dr Susan Peters ""Although a valuable method in occupational epidemiology, job-exposure matrices are no magic fix"" ably describes the strengths and limitations of job-exposure matrix (JEM) approaches in occupational epidemiology research (1). In addition to their use in research, we would like to add that JEM may also be of use in compensation and surveillance efforts in occupational health. JEM could assist the compensation process by supporting the assessment of relevant exposures related to specific health conditions (2). The potential usefulness of a JEM as a decision tool for compensation of work-related musculoskeletal disorders has been examined (3). Because occupational diseases are often under-recognized, another practical application is using a JEM to screen for occupational exposures as part of health surveillance. Use of JEM to screen for asbestos and wood dust exposure in the clinical setting has shown promising results (4-6). By summarizing multiple exposures at a job level (7), JEM may also assist policy-makers in setting priorities for hazards and controls at work, as well as occupational practitioners to target prevention efforts and direct the conduct of more precise exposure measures to particular jobs. Sharing JEM across different countries may be useful in providing estimates of exposures across larger populations to calculate global burden of disease related to occupational exposure. The JEMINI (JEM InterNatIonal) initiative was launched to explore the possibility of developing international JEM that could be used across countries (8). Beginning with physical (biomechanical) exposures, this open group has started homogenizing job coding systems and comparing some available JEM. Estimating differences in the level of exposure between countries will require much more work, without guaranteed success. As Peters mentioned, many limitations exist in the use of JEM. Users of JEM must consider the source of exposure data - expert assessments, data collected from individual workers, or environmental sampling. The coding of occupations is time consuming and can introduce error (9), and more testing of and comparison with automated job coding systems is needed (10). JEM reflect an ""average"" level of exposure within a job at the expense of individual variation. At population level, JEM can offer a useful estimate of exposures. If used at an individual level in a clinical or compensation setting, JEM cannot replace the professionals involved in exposure assessment but may help them focus their action more effectively on complex situations that require their expertise. In conclusion, these JEM developed for research might also be used as a public health tool, provided that their limitations are properly taken into account. References 1. Peters S.

32421805,IRIS3: integrated cell-type-specific regulon inference server from single-cell RNA-Seq.,"A group of genes controlled as a unit, usually by the same repressor or activator gene, is known as a regulon. The ability to identify active regulons within a specific cell type, i.e., cell-type-specific regulons (CTSR), provides an extraordinary opportunity to pinpoint crucial regulators and target genes responsible for complex diseases. However, the identification of CTSRs from single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data is computationally challenging. We introduce IRIS3, the first-of-its-kind web server for CTSR inference from scRNA-Seq data for human and mouse. IRIS3 is an easy-to-use server empowered by over 20 functionalities to support comprehensive interpretations and graphical visualizations of identified CTSRs. CTSR data can be used to reliably characterize and distinguish the corresponding cell type from others and can be combined with other computational or experimental analyses for biomedical studies. CTSRs can, therefore, aid in the discovery of major regulatory mechanisms and allow reliable constructions of global transcriptional regulation networks encoded in a specific cell type. The broader impact of IRIS3 includes, but is not limited to, investigation of complex diseases hierarchies and heterogeneity, causal gene regulatory network construction, and drug development.

32421835,InterPred: a webtool to predict chemical autofluorescence and luminescence interference.,"High-throughput screening (HTS) research programs for drug development or chemical hazard assessment are designed to screen thousands of molecules across hundreds of biological targets or pathways. Most HTS platforms use fluorescence and luminescence technologies, representing more than 70% of the assays in the US Tox21 research consortium. These technologies are subject to interferent signals largely explained by chemicals interacting with light spectrum. This phenomenon results in up to 5-10% of false positive results, depending on the chemical library used. Here, we present the InterPred webserver (version 1.0), a platform to predict such interference chemicals based on the first large-scale chemical screening effort to directly characterize chemical-assay interference, using assays in the Tox21 portfolio specifically designed to measure autofluorescence and luciferase inhibition. InterPred combines 17 quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models built using optimized machine learning techniques and allows users to predict the probability that a new chemical will interfere with different combinations of cellular and technology conditions.

Protein Structure Graphs (PSGs) are computed on a single structure, whereas information on system dynamics is supplied by ENM-NMA. The approach was implemented in a webserver (webPSN), which was significantly updated herein. The webserver now handles both proteins and nucleic acids and relies on an internal upgradable database of network parameters for ions and small molecules in all PDB structures. Apart from the radical restyle of the server and some changes in the calculation setup, other major novelties concern the possibility to: a) compute the differences in nodes, links, and communication pathways between two structures (i.e. network difference) and b) infer links, hubs, communities, and metapaths from consensus networks computed on a number of structures. These new features are useful to identify commonalties and differences between two different functional states of the same system or structural-communication signatures in homologous or analogous systems. The output analysis relies on 3D-representations, interactive tables and graphs, also available for download.

32459325,PaCRISPR: a server for predicting and visualizing anti-CRISPR proteins.,"Anti-CRISPRs are widespread amongst bacteriophage and promote bacteriophage infection by inactivating the bacterial host's CRISPR-Cas defence system. Identifying and characterizing anti-CRISPR proteins opens an avenue to explore and control CRISPR-Cas machineries for the development of new CRISPR-Cas based biotechnological and therapeutic tools. Past studies have identified anti-CRISPRs in several model phage genomes, but a challenge exists to comprehensively screen for anti-CRISPRs accurately and efficiently from genome and metagenome sequence data. Here, we have developed an ensemble learning based predictor, PaCRISPR, to accurately identify anti-CRISPRs from protein datasets derived from genome and metagenome sequencing projects. PaCRISPR employs different types of feature recognition united within an ensemble framework. Extensive cross-validation and independent tests show that PaCRISPR achieves a significantly more accurate performance compared with homology-based baseline predictors and an existing toolkit. The performance of PaCRISPR was further validated in discovering anti-CRISPRs that were not part of the training for PaCRISPR, but which were recently demonstrated to function as anti-CRISPRs for phage infections.

32467965,AOP4EUpest: mapping of pesticides in adverse outcome pathways using a text mining tool.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Exposure to pesticides may lead to adverse health effects in human populations, in particular vulnerable groups. The main long-term health concerns are neurodevelopmental disorders, carcinogenicity as well as endocrine disruption possibly leading to reproductive and metabolic disorders. Adverse outcome pathways (AOP) consist in linear representations of mechanistic perturbations at different levels of the biological organization. Although AOPs are chemical-agnostic, they can provide a better understanding of the Mode of Action of pesticides and can support a rational identification of effect markers.<h4>Results</h4>With the increasing amount of scientific literature and the development of biological databases, investigation of putative links between pesticides, from various chemical groups and AOPs using the biological events present in the AOP-Wiki database is now feasible. To identify co-occurrence between a specific pesticide and a biological event in scientific abstracts from the PubMed database, we used an updated version of the artificial intelligence-based AOP-helpFinder tool.

The website is also the portal into services offered by the UK Immunological Toolbox project that includes antibody generation, sequencing and recombinant expression. The funding for this effort is linked into sustainable sources, but ultimate success relies on community engagement to continually increase the quality and quantity of information. It is hoped that as more users and reagent owners engage, it will become an essential resource for researchers, veterinarians and clinicians alike by removing barriers that prevent the use of the most informative animal models.","hji,kes",1,0,1,2,0.5,,
32569358,COVID-19 TestNorm: A tool to normalize COVID-19 testing names to LOINC codes.,"Large observational data networks that leverage routine clinical practice data in electronic health records (EHRs) are critical resources for research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data normalization is a key challenge for the secondary use of EHRs for COVID-19 research across institutions. In this study, we addressed the challenge of automating the normalization of COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which are critical data elements, but for which controlled terminology terms were published after clinical implementation. We developed a simple but effective rule-based tool called COVID-19 TestNorm to automatically normalize local COVID-19 testing names to standard LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) codes. COVID-19 TestNorm was developed and evaluated using 568 test names collected from 8 healthcare systems. Our results show that it could achieve an accuracy of 97.4% on an independent test set. COVID-19 TestNorm is available as an open-source package for developers and as an online Web application for end users (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/loinc.php). We believe that it will be a useful tool to support secondary use of EHRs for research on COVID-19.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

32592631,"A study on the structure, mechanism, and biochemistry of kanamycin B dioxygenase (KanJ)-an enzyme with a broad range of substrates.","Kanamycin A is an aminoglycoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces kanamyceticus and used against a wide spectrum of bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Biosynthesis of kanamycin involves an oxidative deamination step catalyzed by kanamycin B dioxygenase (KanJ), thereby the C2' position of kanamycin B is transformed into a keto group upon release of ammonia. Here, we present for the first time, structural models of KanJ with several ligands, which along with the results of ITC binding assays and HPLC activity tests explain substrate specificity of the enzyme. The large size of the binding pocket suggests that KanJ can accept a broad range of substrates, which was confirmed by activity tests. Specificity of the enzyme with respect to its substrate is determined by the hydrogen bond interactions between the methylamino group of the antibiotic and highly conserved Asp134 and Cys150 as well as between hydroxyl groups of the substrate and Asn120 and Gln80. Upon antibiotic binding, the C terminus loop is significantly rearranged and Gln80 and Asn120, which are directly involved in substrate recognition, change their conformations. Based on reaction energy profiles obtained by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we propose a mechanism of ketone formation involving the reactive Fe<sup>IV</sup>  = O and proceeding either via OH rebound, which yields a hemiaminal intermediate or by abstraction of two hydrogen atoms, which leads to an imine species. At acidic pH, the latter involves a lower barrier than the OH rebound, whereas at basic pH, the barrier leading to an imine vanishes completely.

Development of computational tools for automatic identification of promoters is in high demand. According to the difference of functions, promoters can be of different types. Promoters may have both intra- and interclass variation and similarity in terms of consensus sequences. Accurate classification of various types of sigma promoters still remains a challenge.<h4>Results</h4>We present iPromoter-BnCNN for identification and accurate classification of six types of promoters-œÉ24,œÉ28,œÉ32,œÉ38,œÉ54,œÉ70. It is a CNN-based classifier which combines local features related to monomer nucleotide sequence, trimer nucleotide sequence, dimer structural properties and trimer structural properties through the use of parallel branching. We conducted experiments on a benchmark dataset and compared with six state-of-the-art tools to show our supremacy on 5-fold cross-validation. Moreover, we tested our classifier on an independent test dataset.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our proposed tool iPromoter-BnCNN web server is freely available at http://103.109.52.8/iPromoter-BnCNN.

32615035,mycoCSM: Using Graph-Based Signatures to Identify Safe Potent Hits against Mycobacteria.,"Development of new potent, safe drugs to treat Mycobacteria has proven to be challenging, with limited hit rates of initial screens restricting subsequent development efforts. Despite significant efforts and the evolution of quantitative structure-activity relationship as well as machine learning-based models for computationally predicting molecule bioactivity, there is an unmet need for efficient and reliable methods for identifying biologically active compounds against Mycobacterium that are also safe for humans. Here we developed mycoCSM, a graph-based signature approach to rapidly identify compounds likely to be active against bacteria from the genus Mycobacterium, or against specific Mycobacteria species. mycoCSM was trained and validated on eight organism-specific and for the first time a general Mycobacteria data set, achieving correlation coefficients of up to 0.89 on cross-validation and 0.88 on independent blind tests, when predicting bioactivity in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration. In addition, we also developed a predictor to identify those compounds likely to penetrate in necrotic tuberculosis foci, which achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.75. Together with a built-in estimator of the maximum tolerated dose in humans, we believe this method will provide a valuable resource to enrich screening libraries with potent, safe molecules. To provide simple guidance in the selection of libraries with favorable anti-Mycobacteria properties, we made mycoCSM freely available online at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/myco_csm.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32626907,Comments on a recent case-control study of malignant mesothelioma of the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis testis.,"As the first case-control study of malignant mesothelioma of the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis testis (mTVT), the paper by Marinaccio et al (1) is potentially an important epidemiologic contribution. A careful review of the paper, however, raises a number of methodological issues. Any case-control study can be viewed as being nested within a conceptual cohort, with controls being sampled from the at-risk cohort as cases arise over time. This view of case-control studies leads to the concept of incidence-density sampling of controls (eg, 2, 3). For Marinaccio et al (1) this would mean that, as cases were registered over the study period, each would be matched to an individual control or set of controls of the same gender, age, and region of the country (since asbestos exposure varies by time and region [4]). For example, if a case were 50 years old in 1995, then any matched control should be close to age 50 in 1995 and of the same gender and from the same region as the case. Matching for age in this fashion automatically results in matching for year of birth, which is essential in this context because birth-cohort effects are determinants of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma incidence (eg, 5-8). If Marinaccio et al (1) used this scheme for age-matching, one would expect to see similar distributions of cases (table 1) and controls (table S3 in the supplemental material) by period of birth. Among males, however, the distributions of mesothelioma cases (whether pericardial or mTVT) and controls by period of birth are clearly different (P<0.001). Among females, the distributions of cases of pericardial mesothelioma and controls by birth year are less dissimilar (P‚âà0.05). Thus, the female cases of pericardial mesothelioma are better matched to controls on year of birth than are male cases of either mTVT or pericardial mesothelioma. We note also that the distributions of male and female controls by year of birth are distinctly different (P<0.002), whereas the birth-year distributions of cases of mesothelioma by site and gender are not (P‚âà0.8). In the Marinaccio et al (1) sensitivity analysis restricted to subjects born before 1950, the distributions of cases and controls by period of birth remain significantly different. Therefore, based on the reported evidence, cases and controls were not matched on birth cohort, thereby possibly biasing the results. Similarly, bias may result from the lack of matching on geographic region; while cases were registered from across Italy, controls were selected from only six regions. Although a sensitivity analysis restricted cases and controls to those from only the six regions, a comparison of tables S1 and S3 indicates that the regional distribution of controls is different from that of person-time observed; that is, the controls do not appear to be representative of the underlying population at risk by region. The second major issue of concern has to do with ascertainment of asbestos exposure. Information on exposure for the cases was presumably obtained at the time of registration. The two sets of controls, obtained from previously unpublished case-control studies, were interviewed during 2014-2015 and 2014-2016; that is, many years after the exposure for most cases was ascertained (1993-2015). Few other details of the control groups are provided, except that participation by one set of controls was <50%, raising additional concerns about selection bias. For details on the second set of controls, Marinaccio et al (1) reference a paper by Brandi et al (9). On review of that paper, however, we found no description of the control group, only references to three earlier papers. Marinaccio et al (1) present analyses only with both sets of controls combined; to evaluate potential sources of bias from the use of different sets of controls, they should also report results using each set of controls separately. The authors also did not detail their methods of exposure classification. For example, what does probable or possible exposure mean? The authors should at least present separate analyses of definite occupational exposure. Eighty cases of mTVT were registered, but only 68 were included in the analyses. Information on the 12 omitted cases (eg, age, year of birth, and region) would be helpful. Marinaccio et al (1) did not provide clear information on what occupations and/or industries they considered as exposed to asbestos. In an earlier study, Marinaccio et al (10) remarked on the absence of pericardial mesothelioma and mTVT in industries with the highest exposures to asbestos, saying, ""[t]he absence of exposures in the shipbuilding, railway and asbestos-cement industries ‚Ä¶ for all the 67 pericardial and testicular cases is noteworthy but not easy to interpret."" By contrast, Marinaccio et al (1) stated, ""[t]he economic sectors more frequently associated with asbestos exposure were construction, steel mills, metal-working industry, textile industry and agriculture."" The possibility of exposure in the ""agriculture economic sector"" was not mentioned in Marinaccio et al (10) and appears not to have been considered in previous epidemiologic studies in Italy. In general, epidemiologic studies indicate that farmers and agricultural workers are not at increased risk of developing mesothelioma (eg, 11-17). The fact that few, if any, cases of mTVT and pericardial mesothelioma occurred in industries traditionally associated with high asbestos exposure raises the possibility that the results of Marinaccio et al (1) are attributable to deficiencies in study design, very possibly bias in the selection of controls, and deficiencies in exposure assessment and classification as described above, leading to a spurious association of occupational exposure with mTVT and male pericardial mesothelioma.

32632821,Efficient System Wide Metabolic Pathway Comparisons in Multiple Microbes Using Genome to KEGG Orthology (G2KO) Pipeline Tool.,"Comparison of system-wide metabolic pathways among microbes provides valuable insights of organisms' metabolic capabilities that can further assist in rationally screening organisms in silico for various applications. In this work, we present a much needed, efficient and user-friendly Genome to KEGG Orthology (G2KO) pipeline tool that facilitates efficient comparison of system wide metabolic networks of multiple organisms simultaneously. The optimized strategy primarily involves automatic retrieval of the KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers of user defined organisms from the KEGG database followed by overlaying and visualization of the metabolic genes using the KEGG Mapper reconstruct pathway tool. We demonstrate the applicability of G2KO via two case studies in which we processed 24,314 genes across 15 organisms, mapped on to 530 reference pathways in KEGG, while focusing on pathways of interest. First, an in-silico designing of synthetic microbial consortia towards bioprocessing of cellulose to valuable products by comparing the cellulose degradation and fermentative pathways of microbes was undertaken. Second, we comprehensively compared the amino acid biosynthetic pathways of multiple microbes and demonstrated the potential of G2KO as an efficient tool for metabolic studies. We envisage the tool will find immensely useful to the metabolic engineers as well as systems biologists. The tool's web-server, along with tutorial is publicly available at https://faculty.iitmandi.ac.in/~shyam/tools/g2ko/g2ko.cgi .

32657416,MutCombinator: identification of mutated peptides allowing combinatorial mutations using nucleotide-based graph search.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Proteogenomics has proven its utility by integrating genomics and proteomics. Typical approaches use data from next-generation sequencing to infer proteins expressed. A sample-specific protein sequence database is often adopted to identify novel peptides from matched mass spectrometry-based proteomics; nevertheless, there is no software that can practically identify all possible forms of mutated peptides suggested by various genomic information sources.<h4>Results</h4>We propose MutCombinator, which enables us to practically identify mutated peptides from tandem mass spectra allowing combinatorial mutations during the database search. It uses an upgraded version of a variant graph, keeping track of frame information. The variant graph is indexed by nine nucleotides for fast access. Using MutCombinator, we could identify more mutated peptides than previous methods, because combinations of point mutations are considered and also because it can be practically applied together with a large mutation database such as COSMIC. Furthermore, MutCombinator supports in-frame search for coding regions and three-frame search for non-coding regions.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://prix.hanyang.ac.kr/download/mutcombinator.jsp.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
32657595,The First Inherited Retinal Disease Registry in Iran: Research Protocol and Results of a Pilot Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>To describe the protocol for developing a national inherited retinal disease (IRD) registry in Iran and present its initial report.<h4>Methods</h4>This community-based participatory research was approved by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran in 2016. To provide the minimum data set (MDS), several focus group meetings were held. The final MDS was handed over to an engineering team to develop a web-based software. In the pilot phase, the software was set up in two referral centers in Iran. Final IRD diagnosis was made based on clinical manifestations and genetic findings. Ultimately, patient registration was done based on all clinical and non-clinical manifestations.<h4>Results</h4>Initially, a total of 151 data elements were approved with Delphi technique. The registry software went live at www. IRDReg.org based on DHIS2 open source license agreement since February 2016. So far, a total of 1001 patients have been registered with a mean age of 32.41¬±15.60 years (range, 3 months to 74 years). The majority of the registered patients had retinitis pigmentosa (42%, 95% CI: 38.9% to 45%). Genetic testing was done for approximately 20% of the registered individuals.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study shows successful web-based software design and data collection as a proof of concept for the first IRD registry in Iran. Multicenter integration of the IRD registry in medical centers throughout the country is well underway as planned. These data will assist researchers to rapidly access information about the distribution and genetic patterns of this disease.","hji,kes",1,0,1,2,0.5,clinical data,registry
32689928,SpectralTAD: an R package for defining a hierarchy of topologically associated domains using spectral clustering.,"<h4>Background</h4>The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation. Chromatin conformation capture technologies (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops. Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally inefficient.<h4>Methods</h4>To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors for TAD boundary identification.<h4>Results</h4>Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SpectralTAD is available on Bioconductor, http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/ .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

32696040,Metasubtract: an R-package to analytically produce leave-one-out meta-analysis GWAS summary statistics.,"<h4>Summary</h4>statistics from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (meta-GWAS) can be used for many follow-up analyses. One valuable application is the creation of polygenic scores. However, if polygenic scores are calculated in a validation cohort that was part of the meta-GWAS consortium, this cohort is not independent and analyses will therefore yield inflated results. The R package 'MetaSubtract' was developed to subtract the results of the validation cohort from meta-GWAS summary statistics analytically. The statistical formulas for a meta-analysis were inverted to compute corrected summary statistics of a meta-GWAS leaving one (or more) cohort(s) out. These formulas have been implemented in MetaSubtract for different meta-analyses methods (fixed effects inverse variance or square root sample size weighted z-score) accounting for no, single or double genomic control correction. Results obtained by MetaSubtract correlate very well to those calculated using the traditional way, i.e. by performing a meta-analysis leaving out the validation cohort. In conclusion, MetaSubtract allows researchers to compute meta-GWAS summary statistics that are independent of the GWAS results of the validation cohort without requiring access to the cohort level GWAS results of the corresponding meta-GWAS consortium.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MetaSubtract.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
32699131,Febrile Illness Evaluation in a Broad Range of Endemicities (FIEBRE): protocol for a multisite prospective observational study of the causes of fever in Africa and Asia.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Fever commonly leads to healthcare seeking and hospital admission in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. There is only limited guidance for clinicians managing non-malarial fevers, which often results in inappropriate treatment for patients. Furthermore, there is little evidence for estimates of disease burden, or to guide empirical therapy, control measures, resource allocation, prioritisation of clinical diagnostics or antimicrobial stewardship. The Febrile Illness Evaluation in a Broad Range of Endemicities (FIEBRE) study seeks to address these information gaps.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>FIEBRE investigates febrile illness in paediatric and adult outpatients and inpatients using standardised clinical, laboratory and social science protocols over a minimum 12-month period at five sites in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeastern and Southern Asia. Patients presenting with fever are enrolled and provide clinical data, pharyngeal swabs and a venous blood sample; selected participants also provide a urine sample. Laboratory assessments target infections that are treatable and/or preventable. Selected point-of-care tests, as well as blood and urine cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, are performed on site. On day 28, patients provide a second venous blood sample for serology and information on clinical outcome. Further diagnostic assays are performed at international reference laboratories. Blood and pharyngeal samples from matched community controls enable calculation of AFs, and surveys of treatment seeking allow estimation of the incidence of common infections. Additional assays detect markers that may differentiate bacterial from non-bacterial causes of illness and/or prognosticate illness severity. Social science research on antimicrobial use will inform future recommendations for fever case management. Residual samples from participants are stored for future use.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Ethics approval was obtained from all relevant institutional and national committees; written informed consent is obtained from all participants or parents/guardians. Final results will be shared with participating communities, and in open-access journals and other scientific fora.

Major functionality includes biomolecular database searching and retrieval, sequence and structure conservation analysis, ensemble normal mode analysis, protein structure and correlation network analysis, principal component, and related multivariate analysis methods. Here, we review recent package developments, including a new underlying segregation into separate packages for distinct analysis, and introduce a new method for structure analysis named ensemble difference distance matrix analysis (eDDM). The eDDM approach calculates and compares atomic distance matrices across large sets of homologous atomic structures to help identify the residue wise determinants underlying specific functional processes. An eDDM workflow is detailed along with an example application to a large protein family. As a new member of the Bio3D family, the Bio3D-eddm package supports both experimental and theoretical simulation-generated structures, is integrated with other methods for dissecting sequence-structure-function relationships, and can be used in a highly automated and reproducible manner. Bio3D is distributed as an integrated set of platform independent open source R packages available from: http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
32742675,Network-based protein structural classification.,"Experimental determination of protein function is resource-consuming. As an alternative, computational prediction of protein function has received attention. In this context, protein structural classification (PSC) can help, by allowing for determining structural classes of currently unclassified proteins based on their features, and then relying on the fact that proteins with similar structures have similar functions. Existing PSC approaches rely on sequence-based or direct three-dimensional (3D) structure-based protein features. By contrast, we first model 3D structures of proteins as protein structure networks (PSNs). Then, we use network-based features for PSC. We propose the use of graphlets, state-of-the-art features in many research areas of network science, in the task of PSC. Moreover, because graphlets can deal only with unweighted PSNs, and because accounting for edge weights when constructing PSNs could improve PSC accuracy, we also propose a deep learning framework that automatically learns network features from weighted PSNs. When evaluated on a large set of approximately 9400 CATH and approximately 12 800 SCOP protein domains (spanning 36 PSN sets), the best of our proposed approaches are superior to existing PSC approaches in terms of accuracy, with comparable running times.

32749460,Development of an online tool for linking behavior change techniques and mechanisms of action based on triangulation of findings from literature synthesis and expert consensus.,"Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers develop interventions to change behavior based on their understanding of how behavior change techniques (BCTs) impact the determinants of behavior. A transparent, systematic, and accessible method of linking BCTs with the processes through which they change behavior (i.e., their mechanisms of action [MoAs]) would advance the understanding of intervention effects and improve theory and intervention development. The purpose of this study is to triangulate evidence for hypothesized BCT-MoA links obtained in two previous studies and present the results in an interactive, online tool. Two previous studies generated evidence on links between 56 BCTs and 26 MoAs based on their frequency in literature synthesis and on expert consensus. Concordance between the findings of the two studies was examined using multilevel modeling. Uncertainties and differences between the two studies were reconciled by 16 behavior change experts using consensus development methods. The resulting evidence was used to generate an online tool. The two studies showed concordance for 25 of the 26 MoAs and agreement for 37 links and for 460 ""nonlinks."" A further 55 links were resolved by consensus (total of 92 [37 + 55] hypothesized BCT-MoA links). Full data on 1,456 possible links was incorporated into the online interactive Theory and Technique Tool (https://theoryandtechniquetool.humanbehaviourchange.org/). This triangulation of two distinct sources of evidence provides guidance on how BCTs may affect the mechanisms that change behavior and is available as a resource for behavior change intervention designers, researchers and theorists, supporting intervention design, research synthesis, and collaborative research.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not life sci - questable if underlying data is available
32753773,hubViz: A Novel Tool for Hub-centric Visualization.,"Visualization algorithms have been widely used for intuitive interrogation of genomic data and popularly used tools include MDS, t-SNE, and UMAP. However, these algorithms are not tuned for the visualization of binary data and none of them consider the hubness of observations for the visualization. In order to address these limitations, here we propose hubViz, a novel tool for hub-centric visualization of binary data. We evaluated the performance of hubViz with its application to the gene expression data measured in multiple brain regions of rats exposed to cocaine, the single-cell RNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with interferon beta, and the literature mining data to investigate relationships among diseases. We further evaluated the performance of hubViz using simulation studies. We showed that hubViz provides effective visual inspection by locating the hub in the center and the contrasting elements in the opposite sides around the center. We believe that hubViz and its software can be powerful tools that can improve visualizations of various genomic data. The hubViz is implemented as an R package hubviz, which is publicly available at https://dongjunchung.github.io/hubviz/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

Since then, it has been wildly spread from Wuhan, China, to Asia, European, and United States to become the pandemic worldwide. Now coronavirus disease 2019 were globally diagnosed over 3 084 740 cases with mortality of 212 561 toll. Current reports variants are found in SARS-CoV-2, majoring in functional ribonucleic acid (RNA) to transcribe into structural proteins as transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein holds the virus RNA genome; the envelope (E) and membrane (M) alone with spike protein form viral envelope. The nonstructural RNA genome includes ORF1ab, ORF3, ORF6, 7a, 8, and ORF10 with highly conserved information for genome synthesis and replication in ORF1ab.<h4>Methods</h4>We apply genomic alignment analysis to observe SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genebank/): MN 908947 (China, C1); MN985325 (United States: WA, UW); MN996527 (China, C2); MT007544 (Australia: Victoria, A1); MT027064 (United States: CA, UC); MT039890 (South Korea, K1); MT066175 (Taiwan, T1); MT066176 (Taiwan, T2); LC528232 (Japan, J1); and LC528233 (Japan, J2) and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org).

32777814,BSAseq: an interactive and integrated web-based workflow for identification of causal mutations in bulked F2 populations.,"<h4>Summary</h4>With the advance of next-generation sequencing technologies and reductions in the costs of these techniques, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) has become not only a powerful tool for mapping quantitative trait loci but also a useful way to identify causal gene mutations underlying phenotypes of interest. However, due to the presence of background mutations and errors in sequencing, genotyping, and reference assembly, it is often difficult to distinguish true causal mutations from background mutations. In this study, we developed the BSAseq workflow, which includes an automated bioinformatics analysis pipeline with a probabilistic model for estimating the linked region (the region linked to the causal mutation) and an interactive Shiny web application for visualizing the results. We deeply sequenced a sorghum male-sterile parental line (ms8) to capture the majority of background mutations in our bulked F2 data. We applied the workflow to 11 bulked sorghum F2 populations and 1 rice F2 population and identified the true causal mutation in each population. The workflow is intuitive and straightforward, facilitating its adoption by users without bioinformatics analysis skills. We anticipate that the BSAseq workflow will be broadly applicable to the identification of causal mutations for many phenotypes of interest.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>BSAseq is freely available on https://www.sciapps.org/page/bsa.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Abnormality of DNA methylation-related functional elements (DMFEs) may lead to dysfunction of regulatory genes in the progression of cancers, contributing to prognosis of many cancers. There is an urgent need to construct a tool to comprehensively assess the impact of DMFEs on prognosis. Therefore, we developed SurvivalMeth (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/survivalmeth) to explore the prognosis-related DMFEs, which documented many kinds of DMFEs, including 309,465 CpG island-related elements, 104,748 transcript-related elements, 77,634 repeat elements, as well as cell-type specific 1,689,653 super enhancers (SE) and 1,304,902 CTCF binding regions for analysis. SurvivalMeth is a convenient tool which collected DNA methylation profiles of 36 cancers and allowed users to query their genes of interest in different datasets for prognosis. Furthermore, SurvivalMeth not only integrated different combinations, including single DMFE, multiple DMFEs, SEs and clinical data, to perform survival analysis on preupload data but also allowed for uploading customized DNA methylation profile of DMFEs from various diseases to analyze. SurvivalMeth provided a comprehensive resource and automated analysis for prognostic DMFEs, including DMFE methylation level, correlation analysis, clinical analysis, differential analysis, DMFE annotation, survival-related detailed result and visualization of survival analysis. In summary, we believe that SurvivalMeth will facilitate prognostic research of DMFEs in diverse cancers.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
32778891,MolAICal: a soft tool for 3D drug design of protein targets by artificial intelligence and classical algorithm.,"Deep learning is an important branch of artificial intelligence that has been successfully applied into medicine and two-dimensional ligand design. The three-dimensional (3D) ligand generation in the 3D pocket of protein target is an interesting and challenging issue for drug design by deep learning. Here, the MolAICal software is introduced to supply a way for generating 3D drugs in the 3D pocket of protein targets by combining with merits of deep learning model and classical algorithm. The MolAICal software mainly contains two modules for 3D drug design. In the first module of MolAICal, it employs the genetic algorithm, deep learning model trained by FDA-approved drug fragments and Vinardo score fitting on the basis of PDBbind database for drug design. In the second module, it uses deep learning generative model trained by drug-like molecules of ZINC database and molecular docking invoked by Autodock Vina automatically. Besides, the Lipinski's rule of five, Pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS), synthetic accessibility (SA) and other user-defined rules are introduced for filtering out unwanted ligands in MolAICal. To show the drug design modules of MolAICal, the membrane protein glucagon receptor and non-membrane protein SARS-CoV-2 main protease are chosen as the investigative drug targets. The results show MolAICal can generate the various and novel ligands with good binding scores and appropriate XLOGP values. We believe that MolAICal can use the advantages of deep learning model and classical programming for designing 3D drugs in protein pocket.

Data was accessed from the Archive of Data on Disability to Enable Policy and research (ADDEP). The primary analysis applied unbiased recursive partitioning to examine the relationship between serum albumin, injury severity, and long-term outcomes. The analysis is accessible via https://rpubs.com/AnhKhoaVo/586028 .<h4>Results</h4>Serum albumin concentration was significantly associated with lower extremity motor scores (LEMS) and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade at admission to rehabilitation. Serum albumin concentrations alone were also significantly associated with change of LEMS and marked recovery (improvement of at least 2 AIS grades and/or recovery to walking) at 1-year post injury. However, after adjusting for admission to rehabilitation LEMS and AIS grade, serum albumin was not significant.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current study partially confirms our previous observations that serum albumin concentrations are associated with neurological outcome after spinal cord injury. As a crude prognostic biomarker, serum albumin concentration could be useful in cases where injury severity cannot be accurately assessed.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

32840574,KORP-PL: a coarse-grained knowledge-based scoring function for protein-ligand interactions.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Despite the progress made in studying protein-ligand interactions and the widespread application of docking and affinity prediction tools, improving their precision and efficiency still remains a challenge. Computational approaches based on the scoring of docking conformations with statistical potentials constitute a popular alternative to more accurate but costly physics-based thermodynamic sampling methods. In this context, a minimalist and fast sidechain-free knowledge-based potential with a high docking and screening power can be very useful when screening a big number of putative docking conformations.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a novel coarse-grained potential defined by a 3D joint probability distribution function that only depends on the pairwise orientation and position between protein backbone and ligand atoms. Despite its extreme simplicity, our approach yields very competitive results with the state-of-the-art scoring functions, especially in docking and screening tasks. For example, we observed a twofold improvement in the median 5% enrichment factor on the DUD-E benchmark compared to Autodock Vina results. Moreover, our results prove that a coarse sidechain-free potential is sufficient for a very successful docking pose prediction.<h4>Availabilityand implementation</h4>The standalone version of KORP-PL with the corresponding tests and benchmarks are available at https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/korp-pl/ and https://chaconlab.org/modeling/korp-pl.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

32926411,Quantitative SEM characterisation of ceramic target prior and after magnetron sputtering: a case study of aluminium zinc oxide.,"Till now electron microscopy techniques have not been used to evaluate the plasma-target interactions undergone during the magnetron sputtering process. The destructive nature of this interaction severely alters the target microstructure. Utilising quantitative microscopy techniques can shed light on the complex plasma and solid-state processes involved which can ultimately lead to improved functional thin film deposition. As a representative functional material, aluminium-doped-zinc oxide (AZO) is an upcoming alternative to conventional transparent electrode wherein the process optimisation is of great importance. In this paper, we evaluate the pre- and post-sputter field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) data for ceramic AZO target fabricated at three final sintering temperatures (1100¬∞C, 1200¬∞C and 1300¬∞C). In all cases, grain boundaries are merged in addition to a visible reduction in the secondary phases which makes segmentation-based image analysis challenging. Through surface statistics (i.e. fractal dimension, autocorrelation length, texture aspect ratio and entropy) as a function of magnification we can quantify the electron microscopy image of the microstructure. We show that the plasma-microstructure interaction leads to an increase in autocorrelation length, texture aspect ratio and entropy for the optimum AZO ceramic sputtering target sintered at 1200¬∞C. Furthermore, a maximum reduction in fractal dimension span (as determined by exponential regression) is also observed for 1200¬∞C. In addition to the evaluation of plasma effects on sintering, our approach can provide a window towards understanding the underlying thin film growth mechanisms. We believe that this technique can be applied to the defect characterisation of a wide range of polycrystalline ceramic sputtering targets (e.g. ITO, CZTS, GAZO and so on) with the ultimate goal of improving the magnetron sputtering process and the resulting functional thin film. LAY DESCRIPTION: Magnetron sputtering allows scientists to make functional thin films on the order of the nanoscale. In this technique, atoms are plucked from a 'target' then placed onto a substrate forming a thin nanometric film: all thanks to magnets, a special power supply and the fourth state of matter (plasma). Understanding what is going on and how to make a 'good' thin film is important for making better light emitting diodes, solar cells and light sensors. Scientists use electron microscopy to see what is going on in the microstructure of the sputtered thin films to fine tune the sputtering recipe. Here, for the first time, we have applied electron microscopy to see the surface of the microstructure before and after magnetron sputtering. This will help us understanding the plasma-microstructure interaction allowing us to make more informed decisions when fine-tuning the sputtering process to get improved thin films. This is a case study of aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) target that could potentially replace indium tin oxide (ITO), which is widely used as a transparent electrode in devices involving light and electricity. In this case, improved characteristics would be lower electrical resistivity and higher transmission of light. We show that it is possible to use a mathematical description (e.g. the fractal dimension) of the scanning electron microscopy picture to show a link between the target surface and the functional properties.

32931552,AFid: a tool for automated identification and exclusion of autofluorescent objects from microscopy images.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Autofluorescence is a long-standing problem that has hindered the analysis of images of tissues acquired by fluorescence microscopy. Current approaches to mitigate autofluorescence in tissue are lab-based and involve either chemical treatment of sections or specialized instrumentation and software to 'unmix' autofluorescent signals. Importantly, these approaches are pre-emptive and there are currently no methods to deal with autofluorescence in acquired fluorescence microscopy images.<h4>Results</h4>To address this, we developed Autofluorescence Identifier (AFid). AFid identifies autofluorescent pixels as discrete objects in multi-channel images post-acquisition. These objects can then be tagged for exclusion from downstream analysis. We validated AFid using images of FFPE human colorectal tissue stained for common immune markers. Further, we demonstrate its utility for image analysis where its implementation allows the accurate measurement of HIV-Dendritic cell interactions in a colorectal explant model of HIV transmission. Therefore, AFid represents a major leap forward in the extraction of useful data from images plagued by autofluorescence by offering an approach that is easily incorporated into existing workflows and that can be used with various samples, staining panels and image acquisition methods. We have implemented AFid in ImageJ, Matlab and R to accommodate the diverse image analysis community.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>AFid software is available at https://ellispatrick.github.io/AFid.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

32976679,Spage2vec: Unsupervised representation of localized spatial gene expression signatures.,"Investigations of spatial cellular composition of tissue architectures revealed by multiplexed in situ RNA detection often rely on inaccurate cell segmentation or prior biological knowledge from complementary single-cell sequencing experiments. Here, we present spage2vec, an unsupervised segmentation-free approach for decrypting the spatial transcriptomic heterogeneity of complex tissues at subcellular resolution. Spage2vec represents the spatial transcriptomic landscape of tissue samples as a graph and leverages a powerful machine learning graph representation technique to create a lower dimensional representation of local spatial gene expression.

32981359,Twenty-Four-Hour Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Their Associations With Blood Pressure Among Adults in China: Baseline Survey of Action on Salt China.,"This study aimed to assess current level of sodium and potassium intake and their associations with blood pressure (BP) using the 24-hour urinary data in a large sample of China. Data from participants aged 18 to 75 years were collected as the baseline survey of Action on Salt China in 2018. Of 5454 adults, 5353 completed 24-hour urine collection. The average sodium, potassium excretion, and sodium-to-potassium molar ratio were 4318.1¬±1814.1 mg/d (equivalent to 11.0¬±4.6 g/d of salt), 1573.7¬±627.1 mg/d, and 5.0¬±2.1, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounding factors and correcting for regression dilution, each 1000-mg increase in sodium excretion was associated with increased systolic BP (1.32 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, 0.92-1.81]) and diastolic BP (0.34 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, 0.09-0.60]). Each 1000-mg increase in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic BP (-3.19 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, -4.38 to -2.20]) and diastolic BP (-1.56 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, -2.29 to -0.90]). Each unit increase in sodium-to-potassium molar ratio was associated with an increase of systolic BP by 1.21 mm‚ÄâHg (95% CI, 0.91-1.60) and diastolic BP by 0.44 mm‚ÄâHg (95% CI, 0.24-0.64). The relationships between sodium and BP mostly increase with the rise of BP quantiles. Potassium shows the opposite trend. The current sodium intake in Chinese adults remains high and potassium intake is low. Sodium and sodium-to-potassium ratio were positively associated with BP, whereas potassium was inversely associated with BP.

32997734,Fijiyama: a registration tool for 3D multimodal time-lapse imaging.,"<h4>Summary</h4>The increasing interest of animal and plant research communities for biomedical 3D imaging devices results in the emergence of new topics. The anatomy, structure and function of tissues can be observed non-destructively in time-lapse multimodal imaging experiments by combining the outputs of imaging devices such as X-ray CT and MRI scans. However, living samples cannot remain in these devices for a long period. Manual positioning and natural growth of the living samples induce variations in the shape, position and orientation in the acquired images that require a preprocessing step of 3D registration prior to analyses. This registration step becomes more complex when combining observations from devices that highlight various tissue structures. Identifying image invariants over modalities is challenging and can result in intractable problems. Fijiyama, a Fiji plugin built upon biomedical registration algorithms, is aimed at non-specialists to facilitate automatic alignment of 3D images acquired either at successive times and/or with different imaging systems. Its versatility was assessed on four case studies combining multimodal and time series data, spanning from micro to macro scales.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Fijiyama is an open source software (GPL license) implemented in Java. The plugin is available through the official Fiji release.

32997753,BEST: a Shiny/R web-based application to easily retrieve cross-related enzyme functional parameters and information from BRENDA.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>BRENDA is the largest enzyme functional database, containing information of 84 000 experimentally characterized enzyme entries. This database is an invaluable resource for researchers in the biological field, which classifies enzyme-related information in categories that are very useful to obtain specific functional and protein engineering information for enzyme families. However, the BRENDA web interface, the most used by researchers with a non-informatic background, does not allow the user to cross-reference data from different categories or sub-categories in the database. Obtaining information in an easy and fast way, in a friendly web interface, without the necessity to have a deep informatics knowledge, will facilitate and improve research in the enzymology and protein engineering field.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the Brenda Easy Search Tool (BEST), an interactive Shiny/R application that enables querying the BRENDA database for complex cross-tabulated characteristics, and retrieving enzyme-related parameters and information readily and efficiently, which can be used for the study of enzyme function or as an input for other bioinformatics tools.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>BEST and its tutorial are freely available from https://pesb2.cl/best/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,interface to another database,
33006570,Automating the Generation of Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Reports: Proof-of-Concept Study Involving Seven Hospitals in Seven Countries.,"<h4>Background</h4>Reporting cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility testing data on a regular basis is crucial to inform antimicrobial resistance (AMR) action plans at local, national, and global levels. However, analyzing data and generating a report are time consuming and often require trained personnel.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to develop and test an application that can support a local hospital to analyze routinely collected electronic data independently and generate AMR surveillance reports rapidly.<h4>Methods</h4>An offline application to generate standardized AMR surveillance reports from routinely available microbiology and hospital data files was written in the R programming language (R Project for Statistical Computing). The application can be run by double clicking on the application file without any further user input. The data analysis procedure and report content were developed based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (WHO GLASS). The application was tested on Microsoft Windows 10 and 7 using open access example data sets. We then independently tested the application in seven hospitals in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the AutoMated tool for Antimicrobial resistance Surveillance System (AMASS), which can support clinical microbiology laboratories to analyze their microbiology and hospital data files (in CSV or Excel format) onsite and promptly generate AMR surveillance reports (in PDF and CSV formats). The data files could be those exported from WHONET or other laboratory information systems. The automatically generated reports contain only summary data without patient identifiers. The AMASS application is downloadable from https://www.amass.website/. The participating hospitals tested the application and deposited their AMR surveillance reports in an open access data repository.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The AMASS is a useful tool to support the generation and sharing of AMR surveillance reports.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
33009809,Detection of mobile genetic elements associated with antibiotic resistance in Salmonella enterica using a newly developed web tool: MobileElementFinder.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinically relevant bacteria is a growing threat to public health globally. In these bacteria, antimicrobial resistance genes are often associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which promote their mobility, enabling them to rapidly spread throughout a bacterial community.<h4>Methods</h4>The tool MobileElementFinder was developed to enable rapid detection of MGEs and their genetic context in assembled sequence data. MGEs are detected based on sequence similarity to a database of 4452 known elements augmented with annotation of resistance genes, virulence factors and detection of plasmids.<h4>Results</h4>MobileElementFinder was applied to analyse the mobilome of 1725 sequenced Salmonella enterica isolates of animal origin from Denmark, Germany and the USA. We found that the MGEs were seemingly conserved according to multilocus ST and not restricted to either the host or the country of origin. Moreover, we identified putative translocatable units for specific aminoglycoside, sulphonamide and tetracycline genes. Several putative composite transposons were predicted that could mobilize, among others, AMR, metal resistance and phosphodiesterase genes associated with macrophage survivability. This is, to our knowledge, the first time the phosphodiesterase-like pdeL has been found to be potentially mobilized into S. enterica.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MobileElementFinder is a powerful tool to study the epidemiology of MGEs in a large number of genome sequences and to determine the potential for genomic plasticity of bacteria. This web service provides a convenient method of detecting MGEs in assembled sequence data.

33016997,ADACT: a tool for analysing (dis)similarity among nucleotide and protein sequences using minimal and relative absent words.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Researchers and practitioners use a number of popular sequence comparison tools that use many alignment-based techniques. Due to high time and space complexity and length-related restrictions, researchers often seek alignment-free tools. Recently, some interesting ideas, namely, Minimal Absent Words (MAW) and Relative Absent Words (RAW), have received much interest among the scientific community as distance measures that can give us alignment-free alternatives. This drives us to structure a framework for analysing biological sequences in an alignment-free manner.<h4>Results</h4>In this application note, we present Alignment-free Dissimilarity Analysis & Comparison Tool (ADACT), a simple web-based tool that computes the analogy among sequences using a varied number of indexes through the distance matrix, species relation list and phylogenetic tree. This tool basically combines absent word (MAW or RAW) computation, dissimilarity measures, species relationship and thus brings all required software in one platform for the ease of researchers and practitioners alike in the field of bioinformatics.

33027504,PredHPI: an integrated web server platform for the detection and visualization of host-pathogen interactions using sequence-based methods.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Understanding the mechanisms underlying infectious diseases is fundamental to develop prevention strategies. Host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) are actively studied worldwide to find potential genomic targets for the development of novel drugs, vaccines and other therapeutics. Determining which proteins are involved in the interaction system behind an infectious process is the first step to develop an efficient disease control strategy. Very few computational methods have been implemented as web services to infer novel HPIs, and there is not a single framework which combines several of those approaches to produce and visualize a comprehensive analysis of HPIs.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce PredHPI, a powerful framework that integrates both the detection and visualization of interaction networks in a single web service, facilitating the apprehension of model and non-model host-pathogen systems to aid the biologists in building hypotheses and designing appropriate experiments. PredHPI is built on high-performance computing resources on the backend capable of handling proteome-scale sequence data from both the host as well as pathogen. Data are displayed in an information-rich and interactive visualization, which can be further customized with user-defined layouts. We believe PredHPI will serve as an invaluable resource to diverse experimental biologists and will help advance the research in the understanding of complex infectious diseases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PredHPI tool is freely available at http://bioinfo.usu.edu/PredHPI/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Sup plementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
33031509,Automated download and clean-up of family-specific databases for kmer-based virus identification.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Here, we present an automated pipeline for Download Of NCBI Entries (DONE) and continuous updating of a local sequence database based on user-specified queries. The database can be created with either protein or nucleotide sequences containing all entries or complete genomes only. The pipeline can automatically clean the database by removing entries with matches to a database of user-specified sequence contaminants. The default contamination entries include sequences from the UniVec database of plasmids, marker genes and sequencing adapters from NCBI, an E.coli genome, rRNA sequences, vectors and satellite sequences. Furthermore, duplicates are removed and the database is automatically screened for sequences from green fluorescent protein, luciferase and antibiotic resistance genes that might be present in some GenBank viral entries, and could lead to false positives in virus identification. For utilizing the database, we present a useful opportunity for dealing with possible human contamination. We show the applicability of DONE by downloading a virus database comprising 37 virus families. We observed an average increase of 16 776 new entries downloaded per month for the 37 families. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of a custom database compared to a standard reference database for classifying both simulated and real sequence data.<h4>Availabilityand implementation</h4>The DONE pipeline for downloading and cleaning is deposited in a publicly available repository (https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/done/src/master/).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,interface to another database,for cleaning databases not a database itself
33039623,The Developmental Chronnecto-Genomics (Dev-CoG) study: A multimodal study on the developing brain.,"Brain development has largely been studied through unimodal analysis of neuroimaging data, providing independent results for structural and functional data. However, structure clearly impacts function and vice versa, pointing to the need for performing multimodal data collection and analysis to improve our understanding of brain development, and to further inform models of typical and atypical brain development across the lifespan. Ultimately, such models should also incorporate genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying brain structure and function, although currently this area is poorly specified. To this end, we are reporting here a multi-site, multi-modal dataset that captures cognitive function, brain structure and function, and genetic and epigenetic measures to better quantify the factors that influence brain development in children originally aged 9-14 years. Data collection for the Developmental Chronnecto-Genomics (Dev-CoG) study (http://devcog.mrn.org/) includes cognitive, emotional, and social performance scales, structural and functional MRI, diffusion MRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and saliva collection for DNA analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation patterns. Across two sites (The Mind Research Network and the University of Nebraska Medical Center), data from over 200 participants were collected and these children were re-tested annually for at least 3 years. The data collection protocol, sample demographics, and data quality measures for the dataset are presented here. The sample will be made freely available through the collaborative informatics and neuroimaging suite (COINS) database at the conclusion of the study.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,Chuck Check - project site - N
33051283,Gender-transformative programming with men and boys to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights: a systematic review of intervention studies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Global health organisations advocate gender-transformative programming (which challenges gender inequalities) with men and boys to improve sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all. We systematically review evidence for this approach.<h4>Methods</h4>We previously reported an evidence-and-gap map (http://srhr.org/masculinities/wbincome/) and <i>systematic review of reviews</i> of experimental intervention studies engaging men/boys in SRHR, identified through a Campbell Collaboration published protocol (https://doi.org/10.1002/CL2.203) without language restrictions between January 2007 and July 2018. Records for the current review of intervention studies were retrieved from those systematic reviews containing one or more gender-transformative intervention studies engaging men/boys. Data were extracted for intervention studies relating to each of the World Health Organization (WHO) SRHR outcomes. Promising programming characteristics, as well as underused strategies, were analysed with reference to the WHO definition of gender-transformative programming and an established behaviour change model, the COM-B model. Risk of bias was assessed using <i>Cochrane Risk of Bias tools,</i> RoB V.2.0 and <i>Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions</i>.<h4>Findings</h4>From 509 eligible records, we synthesised 68 studies comprising 36 randomised controlled trials, n=56‚Äâ417 participants, and 32 quasi-experimental studies, n=25‚Äâ554 participants. Promising programming characteristics include: multicomponent activities of education, persuasion, modelling and enablement; multilevel programming that mobilises wider communities; targeting both men and women; and programmes of longer duration than three‚Äâmonths. Six of the seven interventions evaluated more than once show efficacy. However, we identified a significant risk of bias in the overall available evidence. Important gaps in evidence relate to safe abortion and SRHR during disease outbreaks.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is widely acknowledged by global organisations that the question is no longer <i>whether</i> to include boys and men in SRHR but <i>how</i> to do so in ways that promote gender equality and health for all and are scientifically rigorous. This paper provides an evidence base to take this agenda for programming and research forward.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33054771,smORFunction: a tool for predicting functions of small open reading frames and microproteins.,"<h4>Background</h4>Small open reading frame (smORF) is open reading frame with a length of less than 100 codons. Microproteins, translated from smORFs, have been found to participate in a variety of biological processes such as muscle formation and contraction, cell proliferation, and immune activation. Although previous studies have collected and annotated a large abundance of smORFs, functions of the vast majority of smORFs are still unknown. It is thus increasingly important to develop computational methods to annotate the functions of these smORFs.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we collected 617,462 unique smORFs from three studies. The expression of smORF RNAs was estimated by reannotated microarray probes. Using a speed-optimized correlation algorism, the functions of smORFs were predicted by their correlated genes with known functional annotations. After applying our method to 5 known microproteins from literatures, our method successfully predicted their functions. Further validation from the UniProt database showed that at least one function of 202 out of 270 microproteins was predicted.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a method, smORFunction, to provide function predictions of smORFs/microproteins in at most 265 models generated from 173 datasets, including 48 tissues/cells, 82 diseases (and normal).

Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource-limited environments.<h4>Findings</h4>We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline, which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics that are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

Their identification is increasingly difficult due to lack of adequate toxicological tests. This difficulty is particularly problematic for cosmetic ingredients, because <i>in vivo</i> testing is now banned completely in the European Union.<h4>Objectives</h4>The aim was to identify candidate preservatives as endocrine disruptors by <i>in silico</i> methods and to confirm endocrine receptors' activities through nuclear receptors <i>in vitro</i>.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened preservatives listed in Annex V in the European Union Regulation on cosmetic products to predict their binding to nuclear receptors using the Endocrine Disruptome and VirtualToxLab‚Ñ¢ version 5.8 <i>in silico</i> tools. Five candidate preservatives were further evaluated for androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ERŒ±), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and thyroid receptor (TR) agonist and antagonist activities in cell-based luciferase reporter assays <i>in vitro</i> in AR-EcoScreen, hERŒ±-HeLa-9903, MDA-kb2, and GH3.TRE-Luc cell lines. Additionally, assays to test for false positives were used (nonspecific luciferase gene induction and luciferase inhibition).<h4>Results</h4>Triclocarban had agonist activity on AR and ERŒ± at 1ŒºM and antagonist activity on GR at 5ŒºM and TR at 1ŒºM. Triclosan showed antagonist effects on AR, ERŒ±, GR at 10ŒºM and TR at 5ŒºM, and bromochlorophene at 1ŒºM (AR and TR) and at 10ŒºM (ERŒ± and GR). AR antagonist activity of chlorophene was observed [inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) IC50=2.4ŒºM], as for its substantial ERŒ± agonist at >5ŒºM and TR antagonist activity at 10ŒºM. Climbazole showed AR antagonist (IC50=13.6ŒºM), ERŒ± agonist at >10ŒºM, and TR antagonist activity at 10ŒºM.<h4>Discussion</h4>These data support the concerns of regulatory authorities about the endocrine-disrupting potential of preservatives.

33067342,OpenPepXL: An Open-Source Tool for Sensitive Identification of Cross-Linked Peptides in XL-MS.,"Cross-linking MS (XL-MS) has been recognized as an effective source of information about protein structures and interactions. In contrast to regular peptide identification, XL-MS has to deal with a quadratic search space, where peptides from every protein could potentially be cross-linked to any other protein. To cope with this search space, most tools apply different heuristics for search space reduction. We introduce a new open-source XL-MS database search algorithm, OpenPepXL, which offers increased sensitivity compared with other tools. OpenPepXL searches the full search space of an XL-MS experiment without using heuristics to reduce it. Because of efficient data structures and built-in parallelization OpenPepXL achieves excellent runtimes and can also be deployed on large compute clusters and cloud services while maintaining a slim memory footprint. We compared OpenPepXL to several other commonly used tools for identification of noncleavable labeled and label-free cross-linkers on a diverse set of XL-MS experiments. In our first comparison, we used a data set from a fraction of a cell lysate with a protein database of 128 targets and 128 decoys. At 5% FDR, OpenPepXL finds from 7% to over 50% more unique residue pairs (URPs) than other tools. On data sets with available high-resolution structures for cross-link validation OpenPepXL reports from 7% to over 40% more structurally validated URPs than other tools. Additionally, we used a synthetic peptide data set that allows objective validation of cross-links without relying on structural information and found that OpenPepXL reports at least 12% more validated URPs than other tools. It has been built as part of the OpenMS suite of tools and supports Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. OpenPepXL also supports the MzIdentML 1.2 format for XL-MS identification results.

33086240,The Caregiver Experience After Stroke in a COVID-19 Environment: A Qualitative Study in Inpatient Rehabilitation.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Two-thirds of stroke survivors will require caregiver assistance. Evidence suggests the mental health of caregivers is closely related to patients' health outcomes. The timing of this study intersected with the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that required strict social distancing and hospital visitor policy changes. This study aims to answer the primary research question: What is the level and nature of stress experienced by caregivers of persons with newly-acquired stroke in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the caregiver experience?<h4>Methods</h4>Recruitment occurred from a single inpatient rehabilitation facility. Participants were administered the Perceived Stress Scale and then completed qualitative semistructured interviews. The investigators used a phenomenological, iterative approach to collect and analyze qualitative data. The data were independently coded and categorized before consolidated into primary themes and subthemes.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven informal caregivers' perspectives generated 13 subthemes across 4 primary thematic categories: COVID-19 impact, concerns of the caregiver, coping strategies, and important aspects of the caregiver experience. COVID-19 social distancing necessitated new visitor policies, which presented additional challenges for caregivers.<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4>Caregiver attendance at therapy sessions and frequent, direct communication between staff and caregivers improved caregiver readiness for family member discharge following inpatient rehabilitation. This study shared perspectives from a distinctive time during the COVID-19 pandemic. If visitation for multiple therapy sessions is prohibited, we recommend taking alternative measures to keep the caregiver involved in the plan of care.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A326).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33087719,Density functional theory-based electric field gradient database.,"The deviation of the electron density around the nuclei from spherical symmetry determines the electric field gradient (EFG), which can be measured by various types of spectroscopy. Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) is particularly sensitive to the EFG. The EFGs, and by implication NQR frequencies, vary dramatically across materials. Consequently, searching for NQR spectral lines in previously uninvestigated materials represents a major challenge. Calculated EFGs can significantly aid at the search's inception. To facilitate this task, we have applied high-throughput density functional theory calculations to predict EFGs for 15187 materials in the JARVIS-DFT database. This database, which will include EFG as a standard entry, is continuously increasing. Given the large scope of the database, it is impractical to verify each calculation.

33098409,SolupHred: a server to predict the pH-dependent aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Polypeptides are exposed to changing environmental conditions that modulate their intrinsic aggregation propensities. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) constitutively expose their aggregation determinants to the solvent, thus being especially sensitive to its fluctuations. However, solvent conditions are often disregarded in computational aggregation predictors. We recently developed a phenomenological model to predict IDPs' solubility as a function of the solution pH, which is based on the assumption that both protein lipophilicity and charge depend on this parameter. The model anticipated solubility changes in different IDPs accurately. In this application note, we present SolupHred, a web-based interface that implements the aforementioned theoretical framework into a predictive tool able to compute IDPs aggregation propensities as a function of pH. SolupHred is the first dedicated software for the prediction of pH-dependent protein aggregation.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The SolupHred web server is freely available for academic users at: https://ppmclab.pythonanywhere.com/SolupHred.

33110585,Rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Vietnam government's experience and preliminary success.,"<h4>Background</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic has hit all corners of the world, challenging governments to act promptly in controlling the spread of the pandemic. Due to limited resources and inferior technological capacities, developing countries including Vietnam have faced many challenges in combating the pandemic. Since the first cases were detected on 23 January 2020, Vietnam has undergone a 3-month fierce battle to control the outbreak with stringent measures from the government to mitigate the adverse impacts. In this study, we aim to give insights into the Vietnamese government's progress during the first three months of the outbreak. Additionally, we relatively compare Vietnam's response with that of other Southeast Asia countries to deliver a clear and comprehensive view on disease control strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>The data on the number of COVID-19 confirmed and recovered cases in Vietnam was obtained from the Dashboard for COVID-19 statistics of the Ministry of Health (https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn/). The review on Vietnam's country-level responses was conducted by searching for relevant government documents issued on the online database 'Vietnam Laws Repository' (https://thuvienphapluat.vn/en/index.aspx), with the grey literature on Google and relevant official websites. A stringency index of government policies and the countries' respective numbers of confirmed cases of nine Southeast Asian countries were adapted from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). All data was updated as of 24 April 2020.<h4>Results</h4>Preliminary positive results have been achieved given that the nation confirmed no new community-transmitted cases since 16 April and zero COVID-19 - related deaths throughout the 3-month pandemic period. To date, the pandemic has been successfully controlled thanks to the Vietnamese government's prompt, proactive and decisive responses including mobilization of the health care systems, security forces, economic policies, along with a creative and effective communication campaign corresponding with crucial milestones of the epidemic's progression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Vietnam could be one of the role models in pandemic control for low-resource settings. As the pandemic is still ongoing in an unpredictable trajectory, disease control measures should continue to be put in place in the foreseeable short term.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33116744,Identification of Novel Therapeutic Molecular Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Using Genetic Databases.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Utilization of genetic databases to identify genes involved in ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and their extra-intestinal manifestations.<h4>Methods</h4>Protein coding genes involved in ulcerative colitis (3783 genes), Crohn's disease (3980 genes), uveitis (1043 genes), arthritis (5583 genes), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (1313 genes), and pyoderma gangrenosum (119 genes) were categorized using four genetic databases. These include Genecards: The Human Gene Database (www.genecards.org), DisGeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/), The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (http://ctdbase.org/) and the Universal Protein Resource (https://www.uniprot.org/). NDex, Network Data Exchange (http://www.ndexbio.org/), was then utilized for mapping a unique signal pathway from the identified shared genes involved in the above disease processes.<h4>Results</h4>We have detected a unique array of 20 genes with the highest probability of overlay in UC, CD, uveitis, arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and PSC. Figure 1 represents the interactome of these 20 protein coding genes. Of note, unique immune modulators in different disease processes are also noted. Interleukin-25 (IL-25) and monensin-resistant homolog 2 (MON-2) are only noted in UC, CD, pyoderma gangrenosum, and arthritis. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) is involved in UC, CD, and arthritis. SLCO1B3 is exclusively involved with pyoderma gangrenosum, UC, and CD. As expected, TNF involvement is noted in CD, UC, PSC, and arthritis. Table 1 depicts the detailed result.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our work has identified a distinctive set of genes involved in IBD and its associated extra-intestinal disease processes. These genes play crucial roles in mechanisms of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis and further our understanding of this complex disease process. We postulate that these genes play a critical role at intersecting pathways involved in inflammatory bowel disease, and these novel molecules, their upstream and downstream effectors, are potential targets for future therapeutic agents.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,references other db,not descriptive of resource
33135733,Maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral networks by integer linear programming.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The study of the evolutionary history of biological networks enables deep functional understanding of various bio-molecular processes. Network growth models, such as the Duplication-Mutation with Complementarity (DMC) model, provide a principled approach to characterizing the evolution of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on duplication and divergence. Current methods for model-based ancestral network reconstruction primarily use greedy heuristics and yield sub-optimal solutions.<h4>Results</h4>We present a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution for maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral PPI networks using the DMC model. We prove the correctness of our solution that is designed to find the optimal solution. It can also use efficient heuristics from general-purpose ILP solvers to obtain multiple optimal and near-optimal solutions that may be useful in many applications. Experiments on synthetic data show that our ILP obtains solutions with higher likelihood than those from previous methods, and is robust to noise and model mismatch. We evaluate our algorithm on two real PPI networks, with proteins from the families of bZIP transcription factors and the Commander complex. On both the networks, solutions from our ILP have higher likelihood and are in better agreement with independent biological evidence from other studies.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A Python implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/cdal/network-reconstruction.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

33164522,Comprehensive Study on Molecular Supervised Learning with Graph Neural Networks.,"This work considers strategies to develop accurate and reliable graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecular property predictions. Prediction performance of GNNs is highly sensitive to the change in various parameters due to the inherent challenges in molecular machine learning, such as a deficient amount of data samples and bias in data distribution. Comparative studies with well-designed experiments are thus important to clearly understand which GNNs are powerful for molecular supervised learning. Our work presents a number of ablation studies along with a guideline to train and utilize GNNs for both molecular regression and classification tasks. First, we validate that using both atomic and bond meta-information improves the prediction performance in the regression task. Second, we find that the graph isomorphism hypothesis proposed by [Xu, K.<i>; et al</i> How powerful are graph neural networks? 2018, arXiv:1810.00826. arXiv.org e-Print archive. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826] is valid for the regression task. Surprisingly, however, the findings above do not hold for the classification tasks. Beyond the study on model architectures, we test various regularization methods and Bayesian learning algorithms to find the best strategy to achieve a reliable classification system. We demonstrate that regularization methods penalizing predictive entropy might not give well-calibrated probability estimation, even though they work well in other domains, and Bayesian learning methods are capable of developing reliable prediction systems. Furthermore, we argue the importance of Bayesian learning in virtual screening by showing that well-calibrated probability estimation may lead to a higher success rate.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Despite considerable progress, the correct identification of phosphorylated sites, their quantification, and their interpretation regarding physiological relevance remain challenging. The MS Resource Pillar of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) Human Proteome Project (HPP) initiated the Phosphopeptide Challenge as a resource to help the community evaluate methods, learn procedures and data analysis routines, and establish their own workflows by comparing results obtained from a standard set of 94 phosphopeptides (serine, threonine, tyrosine) and their nonphosphorylated counterparts mixed at different ratios in a neat sample and a yeast background. Participants analyzed both samples with their method(s) of choice to report the identification and site localization of these peptides, determine their relative abundances, and enrich for the phosphorylated peptides in the yeast background. We discuss the results from 22 laboratories that used a range of different methods, instruments, and analysis software. We reanalyzed submitted data with a single software pipeline and highlight the successes and challenges in correct phosphosite localization. All of the data from this collaborative endeavor are shared as a resource to encourage the development of even better methods and tools for diverse phosphoproteomic applications.

33180722,"A Benchmark for Studying Diabetic Retinopathy: Segmentation, Grading, and Transferability.","People with diabetes are at risk of developing an eye disease called diabetic retinopathy (DR). This disease occurs when high blood glucose levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. Computer-aided DR diagnosis has become a promising tool for the early detection and severity grading of DR, due to the great success of deep learning. However, most current DR diagnosis systems do not achieve satisfactory performance or interpretability for ophthalmologists, due to the lack of training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To address this problem, we construct a large fine-grained annotated DR dataset containing 2,842 images (FGADR). Specifically, this dataset has 1,842 images with pixel-level DR-related lesion annotations, and 1,000 images with image-level labels graded by six board-certified ophthalmologists with intra-rater consistency. The proposed dataset will enable extensive studies on DR diagnosis. Further, we establish three benchmark tasks for evaluation: 1. DR lesion segmentation; 2. DR grading by joint classification and segmentation; 3. Transfer learning for ocular multi-disease identification. Moreover, a novel inductive transfer learning method is introduced for the third task. Extensive experiments using different state-of-the-art methods are conducted on our FGADR dataset, which can serve as baselines for future research.

The vaginal microbiome has been suggested to play a role in the development of CC, but the effect of conservative surgical treatment on the microbiome and hrHPV elimination has not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to characterize the vaginal microbiome and inflammatory chemokine profile in 85 women treated for CIN2-CIN3 lesions, before and after surgical CIN removal. The results showed, as expected, a high prevalence of dysbiotic microbiomes and vaginal pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CIN cohort, correlated with disease severity, at the basal level. By contrast, surgical CIN removal induced significant vaginal microbiome variations, and specific microbiome/cytokine profiles were associated with hrHPV clearance/persistence at 6-month follow-up. hrHPV-cleared patients, in fact, showed a specific increase of <i>L. crispatus</i> and decrease of dysbiosis and inflammatory cytokines compared to hrHPV-persistent patients. These data highlight the crosstalk between HPV and the local microbiome, and suggest that vaginal microbiome modulation might represent a novel approach to modifying the natural history of hrHPV-related CC.

We suggest that high consumption of processed meats and/or alcohol is a risk factor for RCC. However, they were not associated with mortality. Further research is needed at an individual level.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2020.1856388.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descriptive of resource

33297866,Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Thrombolysis (0.6 mg/kg) Was Beneficial for Unknown Onset Stroke Above a Certain Core Size: THAWS RCT Substudy.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>We determined to identify patients with unknown onset stroke who could have favorable 90-day outcomes after low-dose thrombolysis from the THAWS (Thrombolysis for Acute Wake-Up and Unclear-Onset Strokes With Alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg) database.<h4>Methods</h4>This was a subanalysis of an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point trial. Patients with stroke with a time last-known-well >4.5 hours who showed a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg intravenously or standard medical treatment. The patients were dichotomized by ischemic core size or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and the effects of assigned treatments were compared in each group. The efficacy outcome was favorable outcome at 90 days, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1.<h4>Results</h4>The median DWI-Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) was 9, and the median ischemic core volume was 2.5 mL. Both favorable outcome (47.1% versus 48.3%) and any intracranial hemorrhage (26% versus 14%) at 22 to 36 hours were comparable between the 68 thrombolyzed patients and the 58 control patients. There was a significant treatment-by-cohort interaction for favorable outcome between dichotomized patients by ASPECTS on DWI (<i>P</i>=0.026) and core volume (<i>P</i>=0.035). Favorable outcome was more common in the alteplase group than in the control group in patients with DWI-ASPECTS 5 to 8 (RR, 4.75 [95% CI, 1.33-30.2]), although not in patients with DWI-ASPECTS 9 to 10. Favorable outcome tended to be more common in the alteplase group than in the control group in patients with core volume >6.4 mL (RR, 6.15 [95% CI, 0.87-43.64]), although not in patients with volume ‚â§6.4 mL. The frequency of any intracranial hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups in any dichotomized patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients developing unknown onset stroke with DWI-ASPECTS 5 to 8 showed favorable outcomes more commonly after low-dose thrombolysis than after standard treatment.

33316147,Older Adults' Engagement in Technology-Mediated Self-Monitoring of Diet: A Mixed-Method Study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>This feasibility study explored older adults' use of a nutrition app called Appetitus (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/appetitt/id1001936854?ign-mpt=uo%3D2; https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nr.appetitt&hl=e) and addressed their engagement in technology-mediated self-monitoring of diet. Undernutrition is a significant challenge among older adults and is associated with poorer health experiences. Digital health for self-monitoring of diet has the potential to increase awareness of personal nutrition, and the scarcity of research reporting older adults' ability and willingness to engage in technology-mediated dietary self-monitoring warranted this study.<h4>Design and methods</h4>An explorative mixed-methods design combining descriptive analysis of log data with qualitative analysis of interviews with Appetitus users was implemented.<h4>Findings</h4>Twenty-five older adults self-monitored their diet using Appetitus over an 8-week trial period. Eighty percent of the participants used the app regularly in the trial period. The most engaged users recorded their food consumption daily for 8 weeks. Personal interest in nutrition and commitment to the project facilitated regular use of Appetitus. Poor health and the perception that using a nutrition app lacked personal relevance contributed to irregular self-monitoring. For inexperienced technology users, participation in this project became a springboard to using tablet technology and the Internet beyond the Appetitus app.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The majority of the participants regularly used Appetitus for self-monitoring of diet; they found the tablet technology and Appetitus app easy to use.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Older adults are able and willing to use self-monitoring tools. Nutrition apps can empower older adults to make better informed decisions about their diet. Patients' self-monitoring can provide valuable and detailed health-related information to healthcare professionals and mediate patient-centered care practices.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

33342295,Markedness and implicational relationships in phonological development: A cross-linguistic investigation.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The complexity approach to speech disorders, based on the theoretical notion of phonological markedness, has been gaining interest over the last decade. In a nutshell, this approach suggests that the acquisition of phonologically marked units (e.g. complex onsets) implies the acquisition of less marked ones (e.g. singleton onsets). However, because the notion of markedness is, itself, subject to controversies, we need to constrain what types of implications can be generalised among language learners, within and across languages.<h4>Method</h4>We report on longitudinal data from one phonologically-disordered and five typically-developing children documented across four different languages (English, French, German, Portuguese), using data from the PhonBank database (https://phonbank.talkbank.org). Using the Phon software program (https://www.phon.ca), we systematically analysed each longitudinal study for consonants in singleton onsets and codas as well as in onset clusters.<h4>Result</h4>The implicational relationships supported by our study involve units of similar types (e.g. relations between different segmental categories), while relationships that involve different types of units or processes cannot be generalised across learners.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A better understanding of implicational relationships makes the complexity approach more predictive of developmental patterns of phonology and related phonological disorders.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,mentions database,not life sci
33346815,FireProtASR: A Web Server for Fully Automated Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction.,"There is a great interest in increasing proteins' stability to widen their usability in numerous biomedical and biotechnological applications. However, native proteins cannot usually withstand the harsh industrial environment, since they are evolved to function under mild conditions. Ancestral sequence reconstruction is a well-established method for deducing the evolutionary history of genes. Besides its applicability to discover the most probable evolutionary ancestors of the modern proteins, ancestral sequence reconstruction has proven to be a useful approach for the design of highly stable proteins. Recently, several computational tools were developed, which make the ancestral reconstruction algorithms accessible to the community, while leaving the most crucial steps of the preparation of the input data on users' side. FireProtASR aims to overcome this obstacle by constructing a fully automated workflow, allowing even the unexperienced users to obtain ancestral sequences based on a sequence query as the only input.

Male rats were randomly split into groups (n = 6): (1) Control (corn oil); (2) DEHP (50 mg/kg b.w./day); (3) DBP (50 mg/kg b.w./day); (4) BPA (25 mg/kg b.w./day); and (5) MIX (50 mg/kg b.w./day DEHP + 50 mg/kg b.w/day DBP + 25 mg/kg b.w./day BPA). Animals were sacrificed after 28 days of oral exposure, testes were extracted and prepared for histological assessments under the light microscope (haematoxylin and eosin staining) and redox status analysis. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://CTD.mdibl.org), Cytoscape software (https://cytoscape.org) and ToppGene Suite (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) were used for data-mining. Present pathohistological study has demonstrated more pronounced testicular toxicity of the MIX group (desquamated germinal epithelium cells, enlarged cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, multinucleated cell forms and intracytoplasmic vacuoles) in comparison with the single substances, while effects on redox status parameters were either more prominent, or present only in the MIX group. In silico investigation revealed 20 genes linked to male reproductive disorders, affected by all three investigated substances. Effects on metabolism, AhR pathway, apoptosis and oxidative stress could be singled out as the most probable mechanisms involved in the subacute DEHP, DBP and BPA mixture testicular toxicity, while the effect on oxidative stress parameters was confirmed by in vivo experiment.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descriptive of resource
33354878,Industry payments to hospitalist physicians: a 5-year analysis of the Open Payments programme from 2014 to 2018.,We analysed Open Payments programme data (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov) on industry-to-physician payments to hospitalists for the years 2014 to 2018. Payments to hospitalists increased by 106.5% from 2014 to 2018 with food and beverage (38.5%) and compensation for services other than consulting (24.3%) being the highest-paid categories. Industry payment to hospitalists was highly skewed with top 10 hospitalists receiving more than 30% of the total payments during the study period. The most common drugs associated with payments were anticoagulant medications (apixaban and rivaroxaban). Industry seems to be spending a significant amount of money to increase awareness of medications among hospitalists.

Among them, 1088 patients from two designated hospitals in Wuhan were used to develop the prognostic model, and 276 patients from three hospitals outside Wuhan were used for external validation. All patients were followed up for a maximal of 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19.<h4>Methods</h4>The model discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Somers' D test, and calibration was examined by the calibration plot. Decision curve analysis was conducted.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19.<h4>Results</h4>The full model included seven predictors of age, respiratory failure, white cell count, lymphocytes, platelets, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. The simple model contained five indicators of age, respiratory failure, coronary heart disease, renal failure and heart failure. After cross-validation, the AUC statistics based on derivation cohort were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.97) for the full model and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.95) for the simple model. The AUC statistics based on the external validation cohort were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98) for the full model and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.96) for the simple model. Good calibration accuracy of these two models was found in the derivation and validation cohort.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prediction models showed good model performance in identifying patients with COVID-19 with a high risk of death in 60 days.

33362409,Bayesian differential programming for robust systems identification under uncertainty.,"This paper presents a machine learning framework for Bayesian systems identification from noisy, sparse and irregular observations of nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed method takes advantage of recent developments in differentiable programming to propagate gradient information through ordinary differential equation solvers and perform Bayesian inference with respect to unknown model parameters using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. This allows an efficient inference of the posterior distributions over plausible models with quantified uncertainty, while the use of sparsity-promoting priors enables the discovery of interpretable and parsimonious representations for the underlying latent dynamics. A series of numerical studies is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, including nonlinear oscillators, predator-prey systems and examples from systems biology.

Given that only a tip of iceberg of drugs was founded in nearly one-century's experimental exploration, it shows great significance to use in silico methods to expand chemical database and profile drug-target linkages. In this study, a web server named ChemGenerator was proposed to generate novel activates for specific targets based on users' input. The ChemGenerator relies on an autoencoder-based algorithm of Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory by training of 7 million of molecular Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System as the basic model, and further develops target guided generation by transfer learning. As results, ChemGenerator gains lower loss (<0.01) than existing reference model (0.2~0.4) and shows good performance in the case of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.

We aimed to develop and validate an image recognition-based structured report generation system (ISRGS) through a multicenter database and to assess its diagnostic performance.<h4>Methods</h4>First, we developed and evaluated an ISRGS combining real-time video capture, site identification, lesion detection, subcharacteristics analysis, and structured report generation. White light and chromoendoscopy images from patients with GI lesions were eligible for study inclusion. A total of 46,987 images from 9 tertiary hospitals were used to train, validate, and multicenter test (6:2:2). Moreover, 5,699 images were prospectively enrolled from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University to further assess the system in a prospective test set. The primary outcome was the diagnosis performance of GI lesions in multicenter and prospective tests.<h4>Results</h4>The overall accuracy in identifying early esophageal cancer, early gastric cancer, early colorectal cancer, esophageal varices, reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer, colorectal polyp, and ulcerative colitis was 0.8841 (95% confidence interval, 0.8775-0.8904) and 0.8965 (0.8883-0.9041) in multicenter and prospective tests, respectively. The accuracy of cecum and upper GI site identification were 0.9978 (0.9969-0.9984) and 0.8513 (0.8399-0.8620), respectively. The accuracy of staining discrimination was 0.9489 (0.9396-0.9568). The relative error of size measurement was 4.04% (range 0.75%-7.39%).<h4>Discussion</h4>ISRGS is a reliable computer-aided endoscopic report generation system that might assist endoscopists working at various hospital levels to generate standardized and accurate endoscopy reports (http://links.lww.com/CTG/A485).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33407073,SPServer: split-statistical potentials for the analysis of protein structures and protein-protein interactions.,"<h4>Background</h4>Statistical potentials, also named knowledge-based potentials, are scoring functions derived from empirical data that can be used to evaluate the quality of protein folds and protein-protein interaction (PPI) structures. In previous works we decomposed the statistical potentials in different terms, named Split-Statistical Potentials, accounting for the type of amino acid pairs, their hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility and type of secondary structure. These potentials have been successfully used to identify near-native structures in protein structure prediction, rank protein docking poses, and predict PPI binding affinities.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the SPServer, a web server that applies the Split-Statistical Potentials to analyze protein folds and protein interfaces. SPServer provides global scores as well as residue/residue-pair profiles presented as score plots and maps. This level of detail allows users to: (1) identify potentially problematic regions on protein structures; (2) identify disrupting amino acid pairs in protein interfaces; and (3) compare and analyze the quality of tertiary and quaternary structural models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>While there are many web servers that provide scoring functions to assess the quality of either protein folds or PPI structures, SPServer integrates both aspects in a unique easy-to-use web server. Moreover, the server permits to locally assess the quality of the structures and interfaces at a residue level and provides tools to compare the local assessment between structures.

The main challenges include continuous increases in the number of polymorphic genetic variants contained in recent GWASs and reference panels, the rising number of cohorts participating in a GWAS consortium, and inclusion of new variant types. Here, we present GWASinspector, a flexible R package for comprehensive QC of GWAS results. This package is compatible with recent imputation reference panels, handles insertion/deletion and multi-allelic variants, provides extensive QC reports and efficiently processes big data files. Reference panels covering three human genome builds (NCBI36, GRCh37 and GRCh38) are available. GWASinspector has a user friendly design and allows easy set-up of the QC pipeline through a configuration file. In addition to checking and reporting on individual files, it can be used in preparation of a meta-analysis by testing for systemic differences between studies and generating cleaned, harmonized GWAS files. Comparison with existing GWAS QC tools shows that the main advantages of GWASinspector are its ability to more effectively deal with insertion/deletion and multi-allelic variants and its relatively low memory use.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our package is available at The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GWASinspector.

Experimental efforts to increase solubility are plagued by low success rates and often reduce biological activity. Computational prediction of protein expressibility and solubility in Escherichia coli using only sequence information could reduce the cost of experimental studies by enabling prioritisation of highly soluble proteins.<h4>Results</h4>A new tool for sequence-based prediction of soluble protein expression in Escherichia coli, SoluProt, was created using the gradient boosting machine technique with the TargetTrack database as a training set. When evaluated against a balanced independent test set derived from the NESG database, SoluProt's accuracy of 58.5% and AUC of 0.62 exceeded those of a suite of alternative solubility prediction tools.

33435732,Rationale and Design of the SAFE-PAD Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials has raised concerns about the long-term safety of paclitaxel-coated peripheral devices used for femoropopliteal artery revascularization. In response to a call for more real-world data on the safety of these devices, the SAFE-PAD study (Safety Assessment of Femoropopliteal Endovascular treatment with Paclitaxel-coated Devices) was designed with input from the Food and Drug Administration to provide a long-term, comprehensive evaluation of the mortality risk associated with paclitaxel-coated devices among Medicare beneficiaries.<h4>Methods and results</h4>SAFE-PAD is an observational cohort study of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries that underwent femoropopliteal artery revascularization with either a drug-coated device or nondrug-coated device from 2015 through 2018. All patients age 66 years or older who underwent revascularization will be identified using a combination of <i>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision</i> procedural codes, Current Procedural Terminology codes, and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System C-codes. The safety end point of all-cause death will be updated semiannually and continued until the median duration of follow-up surpasses 5 years. Sub-group analyses will be conducted by device type, patient characteristics, and procedural setting. Registration: The SAFE-PAD study has been registered on URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04496544.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SAFE-PAD study will evaluate the long-term safety of drug-coated devices compared with nondrug-coated devices for femoropopliteal artery revascularization among a broad, real-world population of patients with peripheral artery disease.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Texture analysis might be an additional tool for the evaluation of Chest X-ray in patients with clinical suspicion of Covid-19 related pneumonia.<h4>Objective</h4>To evaluate the diagnostic performance of texture analysis and machine learning models for the diagnosis of Covid-19 interstitial pneumonia in Chest X-ray images.<h4>Methods</h4>Chest X-ray images were accessed from a publicly available repository (https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). Lung areas were manually segmented using a polygonal regions of interest covering both lung areas, using MaZda, a freely available software for texture analysis. A total of 308 features per ROI was extracted. One hundred-ten Covid-19 Chest X-ray images were selected for the final analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Six models, namely NB, GLM, DL, GBT, ANN and PLS-DA were selected and ensembled. According to Youden's index, the Covid-19 Ensemble Machine Learning Score showing the highest Area Under the Curve (0.971¬±0.015) was 132.57. Assuming this cut-off the Ensemble model performance was estimated evaluating both true and false positive/negative, resulting in 91.8% accuracy with 93% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Moving the cut-off value to -100, although the accuracy resulted lower (90.6%), the Ensemble Machine Learning showed 100% sensitivity, with 80% specificity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Texture analysis of Chest X-ray images and machine learning algorithms may help in differentiating patients with Covid-19 pneumonia. Despite several limitations, this study can lay ground for future researches in this field and help developing more rapid and accurate screening tools for these patients.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33441366,Protocol for a qualitative study to identify strategies to optimise hospital ePrescribing systems.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) is a key area of development and investment in the UK and across the developed world. ePrescribing is widely understood as a vehicle for tackling medication-related safety concerns, improving care quality and making more efficient use of health resources. Nevertheless, implementation of an electronic health record does not itself ensure benefits for prescribing are maximised. We examine the process of optimisation of ePrescribing systems using case studies to provide policy recommendations based on the experiences of digitally mature hospital sites.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Qualitative interviews within six digitally mature sites will be carried out. The aim is to capture successful optimisation of electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) in particular health systems and hospitals. We have identified hospital sites in the UK and in three other developed countries. We used a combination of literature reviews and advice from experts at Optimising ePrescribing in Hospitals (eP Opt) Project round-table events. Sites were purposively selected based on geographical area, innovative work in ePrescribing/electronic health (eHealth) and potential transferability of practices to the UK setting. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed and transcripts coded thematically using NVivo software. Relevant policy and governance documents will be analysed, where available. Planned site visits were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The Usher Research Ethics Group granted approval for this study. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals in medical informatics and expert round-table events, lay member meetings and the ePrescribing Toolkit (http://www.eprescribingtoolkit.com/)-an online resource supporting National Health Service (NHS) hospitals through the ePrescribing process.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Data-informed decision-making strategies to identify individuals at high risk of dementia are essential to facilitate large-scale prevention and early intervention. This population-based case-control study aims to develop and validate a clinical algorithm for predicting dementia diagnosis, based on the cognitive footprint in personal and medical history.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We will use territory-wide electronic health records from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) in Hong Kong between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2018. All individuals who were at least 65 years old by the end of 2018 will be identified from CDARS. A random sample of control individuals who did not receive any diagnosis of dementia will be matched with those who <i>did</i> receive such a diagnosis by age, gender and index date with 1:1 ratio. Exposure to potential protective/risk factors will be included in both conventional logistic regression and machine-learning models. Established risk factors of interest will include diabetes mellitus, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, depression, head injuries and low education. Exploratory risk factors will include vascular disease, infectious disease and medication. The prediction accuracy of several state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms will be compared.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This study was approved by Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 18-225). Patients' records are anonymised to protect privacy. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications. Codes of the resulted dementia risk prediction algorithm will be made publicly available at the website of the Tools to Inform Policy: Chinese Communities' Action in Response to Dementia project (https://www.tip-card.hku.hk/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

While its ultimate goal is to improve the care of patients diagnosed with COPD, the registry is also designed to describe real-life experiences of people with COPD, track key outcomes longitudinally, and assess the effectiveness of interventions. It will retrospectively and prospectively collect information from 3000 patients enrolled in 5 health care organizations. Information will be obtained from electronic health records, and from extended annual and brief questionnaires completed by patients before clinic visits. Core variables to be collected into the APEX COPD registry were agreed on by Delphi consensus and fall into 3 domains: demographics, COPD monitoring, and treatment. Main strengths of the registry include: 1) its size and scope (in terms of patient numbers, geographic spread and use of multiple information sources including patient-reported information); 2) collection of variables which are clinically relevant and practical to collect within primary care; 3) use of electronic data capture systems to ensure high-quality data and minimization of data-entry requirements; 4) inclusion of clinical, database development, management and communication experts; 5) regular sharing of key findings, both at international/national congresses and in peer-reviewed publications; and 6) a robust organizational structure to ensure continuance of the registry, and that research outputs are ethical, relevant and continue to bring value to both patients and physicians.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,Chuck Check - med records out of scope

33459772,SubtypeDrug: a software package for prioritization of candidate cancer subtype-specific drugs.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Cancer can be classified into various subtypes by its molecular, histological, or clinical characteristics. Discovering cancer-subtype-specific drugs is a crucial step in personalized medicine. SubtypeDrug is a system biology R-based software package that enables the prioritization of subtype-specific drugs based on cancer expression data from samples of many subtypes. This provides a novel approach to identify the subtype-specific drug by considering biological functions regulated by drugs at the subpathway level. The operation modes include extraction of subpathways from biological pathways, identification of dysregulated subpathways induced by each drug, inference of sample-specific subpathway activity profiles, evaluation of drug-disease reverse association at the subpathways level, identification of cancer-subtype-specific drugs through subtype sample set enrichment analysis, and visualization of the results. Its capabilities enable SubtypeDrug to find subtype-specific drugs, which will fill the gaps in the recent tools which only identify the drugs for a particular cancer type. SubtypeDrug may help to facilitate the development of tailored treatment for patients with cancer.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The package is implemented in R and available under GPL-2 license from the CRAN website (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SubtypeDrug).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
33464891,TopSuite Web Server: A Meta-Suite for Deep-Learning-Based Protein Structure and Quality Prediction.,"Proteins carry out the most fundamental processes of life such as cellular metabolism, regulation, and communication. Understanding these processes at a molecular level requires knowledge of their three-dimensional structures. Experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryogenic electron microscopy can resolve protein structures but are costly and time-consuming and do not work for all proteins. Computational protein structure prediction tries to overcome these problems by predicting the structure of a new protein using existing protein structures as a resource. Here we present TopSuite, a web server for protein model quality assessment (TopScore) and template-based protein structure prediction (TopModel). TopScore provides meta-predictions for global and residue-wise model quality estimation using deep neural networks. TopModel predicts protein structures using a top-down consensus approach to aid the template selection and subsequently uses TopScore to refine and assess the predicted structures.

The developed system with parallel camera optical axes enables multimodal images: photo, thermal, stereo, and depth map of the wound area to be acquired. As a result of using this system a multimodal database of chronic wound images is introduced. It contains 188 image sets of photographs, thermal images, and 3D meshes of the surfaces of chronic wounds acquired during 79 patient visits. Manual wound outlines delineated by an expert are also included in the dataset. All images of each case are additionally coregistered, and both numerical registration parameters and the transformed images are covered in the database. The presented database is publicly available for the research community at https://chronicwounddatabase.eu. That is the first publicly available database for evaluation and comparison of new image-based algorithms in the wound healing monitoring process with coregistered photographs, thermal maps, and 3D models of the wound area. Easily available database of coregistered multimodal data with the raw data set allows faster development of algorithms devoted to wound healing analysis and monitoring.","hji,kes",1,0,1,2,0.5,,medical - out of scope
33486066,"Making science computable: Developing code systems for statistics, study design, and risk of bias.","The COVID-19 crisis led a group of scientific and informatics experts to accelerate development of an infrastructure for electronic data exchange for the identification, processing, and reporting of scientific findings. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR¬Æ) standard which is overcoming the interoperability problems in health information exchange was extended to evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge with the EBMonFHIR project. A 13-step Code System Development Protocol was created in September 2020 to support global development of terminologies for exchange of scientific evidence. For Step 1, we assembled expert working groups with 55 people from 26 countries by October 2020. For Step 2, we identified 23 commonly used tools and systems for which the first version of code systems will be developed. For Step 3, a total of 368 non-redundant concepts were drafted to become display terms for four code systems (Statistic Type, Statistic Model, Study Design, Risk of Bias). Steps 4 through 13 will guide ongoing development and maintenance of these terminologies for scientific exchange. When completed, the code systems will facilitate identifying, processing, and reporting research results and the reliability of those results. More efficient and detailed scientific communication will reduce cost and burden and improve health outcomes, quality of life, and patient, caregiver, and healthcare professional satisfaction.

33516897,A Hilbert-based method for processing respiratory timeseries.,"In this technical note, we introduce a new method for estimating changes in respiratory volume per unit time (RVT) from respiratory bellows recordings. By using techniques from the electrophysiological literature, in particular the Hilbert transform, we show how we can better characterise breathing rhythms, with the goal of improving physiological noise correction in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Specifically, our approach leads to a representation with higher time resolution and better captures atypical breathing events than current peak-based RVT estimators. Finally, we demonstrate that this leads to an increase in the amount of respiration-related variance removed from fMRI data when used as part of a typical preprocessing pipeline. Our implementation is publicly available as part of the PhysIO package, which is distributed as part of the open-source TAPAS toolbox (https://translationalneuromodeling.org/tapas).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33529135,Disruption of the Atrophy-based Functional Network in Multiple Sclerosis Is Associated with Clinical Disability: Validation of a Meta-Analytic Model in Resting-State Functional MRI.,"Background In multiple sclerosis (MS), gray matter (GM) atrophy exhibits a specific pattern, which correlates strongly with clinical disability. However, the mechanism of regional specificity in GM atrophy remains largely unknown. Recently, the network degeneration hypothesis (NDH) was quantitatively defined (using coordinate-based meta-analysis) as the atrophy-based functional network (AFN) model, which posits that localized GM atrophy in MS is mediated by functional networks. Purpose To test the NDH in MS in a data-driven manner using the AFN model to direct analyses in an independent test sample. Materials and Methods Model fit testing was conducted with structural equation modeling, which is based on the computation of semipartial correlations. Model verification was performed in coordinate-based data of healthy control participants from the BrainMap database (<i>https://www.brainmap.org</i>). Model validation was conducted in prospectively acquired resting-state functional MRI in participants with relapsing-remitting MS who were recruited between September 2018 and January 2019. Correlation analyses of model fit indices and volumetric measures with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and disease duration were performed. Results Model verification of healthy control participants included 80‚Äâ194 coordinates from 9035 experiments. Model verification in healthy control data resulted in excellent model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.037; 90% CI: 0.036, 0.039). Twenty participants (mean age, 36 years ¬± 9 [standard deviation]; 12 women) with relapsing-remitting MS were evaluated. Model validation in resting-state functional MRI in participants with MS resulted in deviation from optimal model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.071; 90% CI: 0.070, 0.072), which correlated with EDSS scores (<i>r</i> = 0.68; <i>P</i> = .002). Conclusion The atrophy-based functional network model predicts functional network disruption in multiple sclerosis (MS), thereby supporting the network degeneration hypothesis. On resting-state functional MRI scans, reduced functional network integrity in participants with MS had a strong positive correlation with clinical disability. ¬© RSNA, 2021 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i>","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descriptive of resource
33529731,Deep learning for the radiographic diagnosis of proximal femur fractures: Limitations and programming issues.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Radiology is one of the domains where artificial intelligence (AI) yields encouraging results, with diagnostic accuracy that approaches that of experienced radiologists and physicians. Diagnostic errors in traumatology are rare but can have serious functional consequences. Using AI as a radiological diagnostic aid may be beneficial in the emergency room. Thus, an effective, low-cost software that helps with making radiographic diagnoses would be a relevant tool for current clinical practice, although this concept has rarely been evaluated in orthopedics for proximal femur fractures (PFF). This led us to conduct a prospective study with the goals of: 1) programming deep learning software to help make the diagnosis of PFF on radiographs and 2) to evaluate its performance.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>It is possible to program an effective deep learning software to help make the diagnosis of PFF based on a limited number of radiographs.<h4>Methods</h4>Our database consisted of 1309 radiographs: 963 had a PFF, while 346 did not. The sample size was increased 8-fold (resulting in 10,472 radiographs) using a validated technique. Each radiograph was evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon using RectLabel‚Ñ¢ software (https://rectlabel.com), by differentiating between healthy and fractured zones. Fractures were classified according to the AO system. The deep learning algorithm was programmed on Tensorflow‚Ñ¢ software (Google Brain, Santa Clara, Ca, USA, tensorflow.org). In all, 9425 annotated radiographs (90%) were used for the training phase and 1074 (10%) for the test phase.<h4>Results</h4>The sensitivity of the algorithm was 61% for femoral neck fractures and 67% for trochanteric fractures. The specificity was 67% and 69%, the positive predictive value was 55% and 56%, while the negative predictive value was 74% and 78%, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results are not good enough for our algorithm to be used in current clinical practice. Programming of deep learning software with sufficient diagnostic accuracy can only be done with several tens of thousands of radiographs, or by using transfer learning.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>III; Diagnostic studies, Study of nonconsecutive patients, without consistently applied reference ""gold"" standard.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Maternal address during pregnancy, infant size at birth [i.e., birth weight, low birth weight (LBW), body length, and birth head circumference] and covariates were compiled from the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Medical Birth Register, and The Integrated Database for Longitudinal Labor Market Research. Linear and logistic models with generalized estimating equations were used to account for multiple births to an individual. Nitrate exposure was modeled using five categories and as a log-transformed continuous variable.<h4>Results</h4>There was evidence of a decreasing trend in models for term birth weight using categorical or continuous measures of exposure. Modeling exposure continuously, a difference of -9.71‚Äâg (95% confidence interval: -14.60, -4.81) was predicted at 25‚Äâmg/L (half the value of the European Union drinking water standard) compared with 0‚Äâmg/L‚ÄâNO3-. Body length also decreased as nitrate concentrations increased in categorical and continuous models. There was little evidence of an association between NO3- and head circumference or LBW.<h4>Discussion</h4>Although the estimated effects were small, our findings for live singleton births to Danish-born parents suggest that maternal intake of nitrate from drinking water may reduce term birth weight and length, which are markers of intrauterine growth. However, there was little evidence for an association between nitrate and head circumference or LBW. Future studies in other populations and with data on dietary sources of nitrate are encouraged to confirm or refute these findings. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7331.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

To extract useful information there is the need to extract spatial and temporal data on the particles that are in the images, but particle tracking and feature extraction need some kind of assistance.<h4>Results</h4>This manuscript introduces our new freely downloadable toolbox, the Visual4DTracker. It is a MATLAB package implementing several useful functionalities to navigate, analyse and proof-read the track of each particle detected in any [Formula: see text] stack. Furthermore, it allows users to proof-read and to evaluate the traces with respect to a given gold standard. The Visual4DTracker toolbox permits the users to visualize and save all the generated results through a user-friendly graphical user interface. This tool has been successfully used in three applicative examples. The first processes synthetic data to show all the software functionalities. The second shows how to process a 4D image stack showing the time-lapse growth of Drosophila cells in an embryo. The third example presents the quantitative analysis of insulin granules in living beta-cells, showing that such particles have two main dynamics that coexist inside the cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Visual4DTracker is a software package for MATLAB to visualize, handle and manually track [Formula: see text] stacks of microscopy images containing objects such cells, granules, etc..

33563213,lncEvo: automated identification and conservation study of long noncoding RNAs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Long noncoding RNAs represent a large class of transcripts with two common features: they exceed an arbitrary length threshold of 200 nt and are assumed to not encode proteins. Although a growing body of evidence indicates that the vast majority of lncRNAs are potentially nonfunctional, hundreds of them have already been revealed to perform essential gene regulatory functions or to be linked to a number of cellular processes, including those associated with the etiology of human diseases. To better understand the biology of lncRNAs, it is essential to perform a more in-depth study of their evolution. In contrast to protein-encoding transcripts, however, they do not show the strong sequence conservation that usually results from purifying selection; therefore, software that is typically used to resolve the evolutionary relationships of protein-encoding genes and transcripts is not applicable to the study of lncRNAs.<h4>Results</h4>To tackle this issue, we developed lncEvo, a computational pipeline that consists of three modules: (1) transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data, (2) prediction of lncRNAs, and (3) conservation study-a genome-wide comparison of lncRNA transcriptomes between two species of interest, including search for orthologs. Importantly, one can choose to apply lncEvo solely for transcriptome assembly or lncRNA prediction, without calling the conservation-related part.<h4>Conclusions</h4>lncEvo is an all-in-one tool built with the Nextflow framework, utilizing state-of-the-art software and algorithms with customizable trade-offs between speed and sensitivity, ease of use and built-in reporting functionalities.

33568057,GalaxyTrakr: a distributed analysis tool for public health whole genome sequence data accessible to non-bioinformaticians.,"<h4>Background</h4>Processing and analyzing whole genome sequencing (WGS) is computationally intense: a single Illumina MiSeq WGS run produces‚Äâ~‚Äâ1 million 250-base-pair reads for each of 24 samples. This poses significant obstacles for smaller laboratories, or laboratories not affiliated with larger projects, which may not have dedicated bioinformatics staff or computing power to effectively use genomic data to protect public health. Building on the success of the cloud-based Galaxy bioinformatics platform ( http://galaxyproject.org ), already known for its user-friendliness and powerful WGS analytical tools, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created a customized 'instance' of the Galaxy environment, called GalaxyTrakr ( https://www.galaxytrakr.org ), for use by laboratory scientists performing food-safety regulatory research. The goal was to enable laboratories outside of the FDA internal network to (1) perform quality assessments of sequence data, (2) identify links between clinical isolates and positive food/environmental samples, including those at the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence read archive ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/ ), and (3) explore new methodologies such as metagenomics.

33579190,A graph-based algorithm for detecting rigid domains in protein structures.,"<h4>Background</h4>Conformational transitions are implicated in the biological function of many proteins. Structural changes in proteins can be described approximately as the relative movement of rigid domains against each other. Despite previous efforts, there is a need to develop new domain segmentation algorithms that are capable of analysing the entire structure database efficiently and do not require the choice of protein-dependent tuning parameters such as the number of rigid domains.<h4>Results</h4>We develop a graph-based method for detecting rigid domains in proteins. Structural information from multiple conformational states is represented by a graph whose nodes correspond to amino acids. Graph clustering algorithms allow us to reduce the graph and run the Viterbi algorithm on the associated line graph to obtain a segmentation of the input structures into rigid domains. In contrast to many alternative methods, our approach does not require knowledge about the number of rigid domains. Moreover, we identified default values for the algorithmic parameters that are suitable for a large number of conformational ensembles. We test our algorithm on examples from the DynDom database and illustrate our method on various challenging systems whose structural transitions have been studied extensively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results strongly suggest that our graph-based algorithm forms a novel framework to characterize structural transitions in proteins via detecting their rigid domains.

33592504,TAP 1.0: A robust immunoinformatic tool for the prediction of tumor T-cell antigens based on AAindex properties.,"Immunotherapy is a research area with great potential in drug discovery for cancer treatment. Because of the capacity of tumor antigens to activate the immune response and promote the destruction of tumor cells, they are considered excellent immunotherapeutic drugs. In this work, we evaluated fifteen machine learning algorithms for the classification of tumor antigens. For this purpose, we build robust datasets, carefully selected from the TANTIGEN and IEDB databases. The feature computation of all antigens in this study was performed by developing a script written in Python 3.8, which allowed the calculation of 544 physicochemical and biochemical properties extracted from the AAindex database. All classifiers were subjected to the training, 10-fold cross-validation, and testing on an independent dataset. The results of this study showed that the quadratic discriminant classifier presented the best performance measures over the independent dataset, accuracy = 0.7384, AUC = 0.817, recall = 0.676, precision = 0.7857, F1 = 0.713, kappa = 0.4764, and Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.4834, outperforming common machine learning classifiers used in the bioinformatics area. We believe that our prediction model could be of great importance in the field of cancer immunotherapy for the search of potential tumor antigens. Taking all aspects mentioned before, we developed an immunoinformatic tool called TAP 1.0 with a friendly interface for tumor antigens prediction, available at https://tapredictor.herokuapp.com/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,extracted data - used for methods
33593821,Therapeutic Targeting of DGKA-Mediated Macropinocytosis Leads to Phospholipid Reprogramming in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare destructive lung disease affecting primarily women and is the primary lung manifestation of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In lymphangioleiomyomatosis, biallelic loss of TSC1/2 leads to hyperactivation of mTORC1 and inhibition of autophagy. To determine how the metabolic vulnerabilities of TSC2-deficient cells can be targeted, we performed a high-throughput screen utilizing the ""Repurposing"" library at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (Cambridge, MA), with or without the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. Ritanserin, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKA), was identified as a selective inhibitor of proliferation of Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), with no impact on Tsc2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs. DGKA is a lipid kinase that metabolizes diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, a key component of plasma membranes. Phosphatidic acid levels were increased 5-fold in Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs compared with Tsc2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs, and treatment of Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs with ritanserin led to depletion of phosphatidic acid as well as rewiring of phospholipid metabolism. Macropinocytosis is known to be upregulated in TSC2-deficient cells. Ritanserin decreased macropinocytic uptake of albumin, limited the number of lysosomes, and reduced lysosomal activity in Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. In a mouse model of TSC, ritanserin treatment decreased cyst frequency and volume, and in a mouse model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, genetic downregulation of DGKA prevented alveolar destruction and airspace enlargement. Collectively, these data indicate that DGKA supports macropinocytosis in TSC2-deficient cells to maintain phospholipid homeostasis and promote proliferation. Targeting macropinocytosis with ritanserin may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of TSC and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies macropinocytosis and phospholipid metabolism as novel mechanisms of metabolic homeostasis in mTORC1-hyperactive cells and suggest ritanserin as a novel therapeutic strategy for use in mTORC1-hyperactive tumors, including pancreatic cancer.

33622334,Identification of major depressive disorder disease-related genes and functional pathways based on system dynamic changes of network connectivity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading psychiatric disorder that involves complex abnormal biological functions and neural networks. This study aimed to compare the changes in the network connectivity of different brain tissues under different pathological conditions, analyzed the biological pathways and genes that are significantly related to disease progression, and further predicted the potential therapeutic drug targets.<h4>Methods</h4>Expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed with postmortem cingulate cortex (ACC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) mRNA expression profile datasets downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including 76 MDD patients and 76 healthy subjects in ACC and 63 MDD patients and 63 healthy subjects in PFC. The co-expression network construction was based on system network analysis. The function of the genes was annotated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD, http://www.hprd.org/ ) was used for gene interaction relationship mapping.<h4>Results</h4>We filtered 586 DEGs in ACC and 616 DEGs in PFC for further analysis. By constructing the co-expression network, we found that the gene connectivity was significantly reduced under disease conditions (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04 in PFC and P‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.227e-09 in ACC). Crosstalk analysis showed that CD19, PTDSS2 and NDST2 were significantly differentially expressed in ACC and PFC of MDD patients. Among them, CD19 and PTDSS2 have been targeted by several drugs in the Drugbank database. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that the function of CD19 and PTDSS2 were enriched with the pathway of Glycerophospholipid metabolism and T cell receptor signaling pathway.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Co-expression network and tissue comparing analysis can identify signaling pathways and cross talk genes related to MDD, which may provide novel insight for understanding the molecular mechanisms of MDD.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descriptive of resource
33630831,A plasmid DNA-launched SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system and coronavirus toolkit for COVID-19 research.,"The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the underlying cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a worldwide pandemic causing substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic devastation. In response, many laboratories have redirected attention to SARS-CoV-2, meaning there is an urgent need for tools that can be used in laboratories unaccustomed to working with coronaviruses. Here we report a range of tools for SARS-CoV-2 research. First, we describe a facile single plasmid SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system that is simple to genetically manipulate and can be used to rescue infectious virus through transient transfection (without in vitro transcription or additional expression plasmids). The rescue system is accompanied by our panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (against nearly every viral protein), SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, and SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines, which are all openly available to the scientific community. Using these tools, we demonstrate here that the controversial ORF10 protein is expressed in infected cells. Furthermore, we show that the promising repurposed antiviral activity of apilimod is dependent on TMPRSS2 expression. Altogether, our SARS-CoV-2 toolkit, which can be directly accessed via our website at https://mrcppu-covid.bio/, constitutes a resource with considerable potential to advance COVID-19 vaccine design, drug testing, and discovery science.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

33633572,TOXPANEL: A Gene-Set Analysis Tool to Assess Liver and Kidney Injuries.,"Gene-set analysis is commonly used to identify trends in gene expression when cells, tissues, organs, or organisms are subjected to conditions that differ from those within the normal physiological range. However, tools for gene-set analysis to assess liver and kidney injury responses are less common. Furthermore, most websites for gene-set analysis lack the option for users to customize their gene-set database. Here, we present the ToxPanel website, which allows users to perform gene-set analysis to assess liver and kidney injuries using activation scores based on gene-expression fold-change values. The results are graphically presented to assess constituent injury phenotypes (histopathology), with interactive result tables that identify the main contributing genes to a given signal. In addition, ToxPanel offers the flexibility to analyze any set of custom genes based on gene fold-change values. ToxPanel is publically available online at https://toxpanel.bhsai.org. ToxPanel allows users to access our previously developed liver and kidney injury gene sets, which we have shown in previous work to yield robust results that correlate with the degree of injury.

33634706,Autonomic Alterations After Pulmonary Vein Isolation in the CIRCA-DOSE (Cryoballoon vs Irrigated Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation) Study.,"Background The natural history of autonomic alterations following catheter ablation of drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is poorly defined, largely because of the historical reliance on non-invasive intermittent rhythm monitoring for outcome ascertainment. Methods and Results The study included 346 patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing pulmonary vein isolation using contemporary advanced-generation ablation technologies. All patients underwent insertion of a Reveal LINQ (Medtronic) implantable cardiac monitor before ablation. The implantable cardiac monitor continuously recorded physical activity, heart rate variability (measured as the SD of the average normal-to-normal), daytime heart rate, and nighttime heart rate. Longitudinal autonomic data in the 2-month period leading up to the date of ablation were compared with the period from 91 to 365 days following ablation. Following ablation there was a significant decrease in SD of the average normal-to-normal (mean difference versus baseline of 19.3 ms; range, 12.9-25.7; <i>P</i><0.0001), and significant increases in daytime and nighttime heart rates (mean difference versus baseline of 9.6 bpm; range, 7.4-11.8; <i>P</i><0.0001, and 7.4 bpm; range, 5.4-9.3; <i>P</i><0.0001, respectively). Patients free of arrhythmia recurrence had significantly faster daytime (11¬±11 versus 8¬±12 bpm, <i>P</i>=0.001) and nighttime heart rates (8¬±9 versus 6¬±8 bpm, <i>P</i>=0.049), but no difference in SD of the average normal-to-normal (<i>P</i>=0.09) compared with those with atrial fibrillation recurrence. Ablation technology and cryoablation duration did not influence these autonomic nervous system effects. Conclusions Pulmonary vein isolation results in significant sustained changes in the heart rate parameters related to autonomic function. These changes are correlated with procedural outcome and are independent of the ablation technology used.

Carbapenem-resistant <i>E. coli</i> prevalence was high in market wastewaters [30% (95% CI: 15.0, 45.0)] but low in humans (1%) and poultry (1%). Human, poultry, and wastewater isolates shared common resistance genes: blaCTX-M-1, <i>qnr</i>, and blaTEM. Human colonization was not significantly associated with exposure to poultry or setting (rural, farm, or market). Ninety-five percent of commercial poultry farms routinely administered antibiotics. Susceptibility tests were significantly different in household vs. farm and market poultry isolates for four of seven antibiotic classes. In human isolates, there were no differences except aminoglycoside resistance (16.4% high vs. 4.4% low exposure, p=0.02). Urban market wastewaters and poultry samples had significantly higher concentrations of ESBL-EC (p<0.001) and blaCTX-M-1 (p<0.001) compared with samples from farms and rural households.<h4>Discussion</h4>ESBL-EC colonization was high in humans but not significantly associated with exposure to poultry. Bidirectional transmission of antibiotic resistance is likely between humans, poultry, and the environment in these community settings, underlining the importance of One Health mitigation strategies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7670.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Here we present a compilation of all the symptoms and patients with primary CoQ deficiency described in the literature so far and analyse the most common clinical manifestations associated with pathogenic variants identified in the different COQ genes. In addition, we identified new associations between the age of onset of symptoms and different pathogenic variants, which could help to a better diagnosis and guided treatment. To make these results useable for clinicians, we created an online platform (https://coenzymeQbiology.github.io/clinic-CoQ-deficiency) about clinical manifestations of primary CoQ deficiency that will be periodically updated to incorporate new information published in the literature. Since CoQ primary deficiency is a rare disease, the available data are still limited, but as new patients are added over time, this tool could become a key resource for a more efficient diagnosis of this pathology.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,out of scope

33719338,Construction of circRNA-Based ceRNA Network to Reveal the Role of circRNAs in the Progression and Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"<h4>Background</h4>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are now under hot discussion as novel promising biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of our study is to identify several competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks related to the prognosis and progression of HCC and to further investigate the mechanism of their influence on tumor progression.<h4>Methods</h4>First, we obtained gene expression data related to liver cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (http://www.portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), including microRNA (miRNA) sequence, RNA sequence, and clinical information. A co-expression network was constructed through the Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) software package in R software. The differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) in the key module were analyzed with the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) to perform functional enrichment analysis including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). The data of miRNA expression and clinical information downloaded from TCGA were utilized for survival analysis to detach the prognostic value of the DEmiRNAs of the key module.<h4>Results</h4>The 201 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 3,783 DEmRNAs were preliminarily identified through differential expression analysis. The co-expression networks of DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs were constructed with WGCNA. Further analysis confirmed four miRNAs in the most significant module (blue module) were associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients with liver cancer, including hsa-miR-92b-3p, hsa-miR-122-3p, hsa-miR-139-5p, and hsa-miR-7850-5p. DAVID was used for functional enrichment analysis of 286 co-expressed mRNAs. The GO analysis results showed that the top enriched GO terms were oxidation-reduction process, extracellular exosome, and iron ion binding. In KEGG pathway analysis, the top three enriched terms included metabolic pathways, fatty acid degradation, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation. In addition, we intersected the miRNA-mRNA interaction prediction results with the differentially expressed and prognostic mRNAs. We found that hsa-miR-92b-3p can be related to CPEB3 and ACADL. By overlapping the data of predicted circRNAs by circBank and differentially expressed circRNAs of GSE94508, we screened has_circ_0077210 as the upstream regulatory molecule of hsa-miR-92b-3p. Hsa_circ_0077210/hsa-miR-92b-3p/cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein-3 (CPEB3) and acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long chain (ACADL) were validated in HCC tissue.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our research provides a mechanistic elucidation of the unknown ceRNA regulatory network in HCC. Hsa_circ_0077210 might serve a momentous therapeutic role to restrain the occurrence and development of HCC.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descriptive of resource
33728932,Metabolic Dyslipidemia and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From the Look AHEAD Study.,"Background Metabolic dyslipidemia (high triglyceride) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The extent to which diabetes mellitus-related abnormalities in the triglyceride-HDL-C profile associates with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is incompletely understood. We evaluated the associations of triglyceride and HDL-C status with CVD outcomes in individuals with T2DM. Methods and Results We analyzed data from 4199 overweight/obese adults with T2DM free of CVD with available data on triglyceride and HDL-C at baseline (2001-2004) in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study. We used Cox proportional models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of: (1) composite CVD outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for angina, and/or death from cardiovascular causes); (2) coronary artery disease events; and (3) cerebrovascular accidents (stroke). Of the 4199 participants, 62% (n=2600) were women, with a mean age of 58 years (SD, 7), and 40% (n=1659) had metabolic dyslipidemia at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 9.5 years (interquartile range, 8.7-10.3), 500 participants experienced the composite CVD outcome, 396 experienced coronary artery disease events, and 100 experienced stroke. Low HDL-C was associated with higher hazards of the composite CVD outcome (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.64 [<i>P</i>=0.002]) and coronary artery disease events (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18-1.81 [<i>P</i>=0.001]) but not stroke (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.90-2.11 [<i>P</i>=0.140]). Compared with patients with normal triglyceride and normal HDL, participants with metabolic dyslipidemia had higher risks of the composite CVD outcome (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03-1.63 [<i>P</i>=0.025]) and coronary artery disease events (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.14-1.93 [<i>P</i>=0.003]) but not stroke (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.74-2.05 [<i>P</i>=0.420]). Conclusions In a large sample of overweight/obese individuals with T2DM, metabolic dyslipidemia was associated with higher risks of CVD outcomes. Our findings highlight the necessity to account for metabolic dyslipidemia in CVD risk stratification among patients with T2DM.

33729791,Epigenetic Target Profiler: A Web Server to Predict Epigenetic Targets of Small Molecules.,"The identification of protein targets of small molecules is essential for drug discovery. With the increasing amount of chemogenomic data in the public domain, multiple ligand-based models for target prediction have emerged. However, these models are generally biased by the number of known ligands for different targets, which involves an under-representation of epigenetic targets, and despite the increasing importance of epigenetic targets in drug discovery, there are no open tools for epigenetic target prediction. In this work, we introduce Epigenetic Target Profiler (ETP), a freely accessible and easy-to-use web application for the prediction of epigenetic targets of small molecules. For a query compound, ETP predicts its bioactivity profile over a panel of 55 different epigenetic targets. To that aim, ETP uses a consensus model based on two binary classification models for each target, relying on support vector machines and built on molecular fingerprints of different design. A distance-to-model parameter related to the reliability of the predictions is included to facilitate their interpretability and assist in the identification of small molecules with potential epigenetic activity.

33735471,Update of the CLRP eye plaque brachytherapy database for photon-emitting sources.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To update and extend the Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy Physics (CLRP) Eye Plaque (EP) dosimetry database for low-energy photon-emitting brachytherapy sources using egs_brachy, an open-source EGSnrc application. The previous database, CLRP_EPv1, contained datasets for the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) plaques (10-22 mm diameter) with <sup>103</sup> Pd or <sup>125</sup> I seeds (BrachyDose-computed, 2008). The new database, CLRP_EPv2, consists of newly calculated three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions for 17 plaques [eight COMS, five Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG, and four others representative of models used worldwide] for <sup>103</sup> Pd, <sup>125</sup> I, and <sup>131</sup> Cs seeds.<h4>Acquisition and validation methods</h4>Plaque models are developed with egs_brachy, based on published/manufacturer dimensions and material data. The BEBIG plaques (modeled for the first time) are identical in dimensions to COMS plaques but differ in elemental composition and/or density. Previously benchmarked seed models are used. Eye plaques and seeds are simulated at the center of full-scatter water phantoms, scoring in (0.05 cm)<sup>3</sup> voxels spanning the eye for scenarios: (a) ""HOMO"": simulated TG43 conditions; (b) ""HETERO"": eye plaques and seeds fully modeled; (c) ""HETsi"" (BEBIG only): one seed is active at a time with other seed geometries present but not emitting photons (inactive); summation over all i seeds in a plaque then yields ""HETsum"" (includes interseed effects). For validation, doses are compared to those from CLRP_EPv1 and published data.<h4>Data format and access</h4>Data are available at https://physics.carleton.ca/clrp/eye_plaque_v2, http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/EPv2. The data consist of 3D dose distributions (text-based EGSnrc ""3ddose"" file format) and graphical presentations of the comparisons to previously published data.<h4>Potential applications</h4>The CLRP_EPv2 database provides accurate reference 3D dose distributions to advance ocular brachytherapy dose evaluations. The fully-benchmarked eye plaque models will be freely distributed with egs_brachy, supporting adoption of model-based dose evaluations as recommended by TG-129, TG-186, and TG-221.","hji,kes",1,0,1,2,0.5,,out of scope
33750020,KnetMiner: a comprehensive approach for supporting evidence-based gene discovery and complex trait analysis across species.,"The generation of new ideas and scientific hypotheses is often the result of extensive literature and database searches, but, with the growing wealth of public and private knowledge, the process of searching diverse and interconnected data to generate new insights into genes, gene networks, traits and diseases is becoming both more complex and more time-consuming. To guide this technically challenging data integration task and to make gene discovery and hypotheses generation easier for researchers, we have developed a comprehensive software package called KnetMiner which is open-source and containerized for easy use. KnetMiner is an integrated, intelligent, interactive gene and gene network discovery platform that supports scientists explore and understand the biological stories of complex traits and diseases across species. It features fast algorithms for generating rich interactive gene networks and prioritizing candidate genes based on knowledge mining approaches. KnetMiner is used in many plant science institutions and has been adopted by several plant breeding organizations to accelerate gene discovery. The software is generic and customizable and can therefore be readily applied to new species and data types; for example, it has been applied to pest insects and fungal pathogens; and most recently repurposed to support COVID-19 research. Here, we give an overview of the main approaches behind KnetMiner and we report plant-centric case studies for identifying genes, gene networks and trait relationships in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), as well as, an evidence-based approach to rank candidate genes under a large Arabidopsis thaliana QTL.

As advances occur in our capability to create more detailed fault-based hazard models, depending on the availability of primary data and observations, it is desirable that such data can be organized in a way that is easily understood and incorporated into present and future models. The database structure presented herein aims to assist this process. We recommend stating what observations have led to different location and activity certainty and presenting slip-rate data with point location coordinates of where the data were collected with the time periods over which they were calculated. Such data reporting allows more complete uncertainty analyses in hazard and risk modelling.

33759252,MS Amanda 2.0: Advancements in the standalone implementation.,"<h4>Rationale</h4>Database search engines are the preferred method to identify peptides in mass spectrometry data. However, valuable software is in this context not only defined by a powerful algorithm to separate correct from false identifications, but also by constant maintenance and continuous improvements.<h4>Methods</h4>In 2014, we presented our peptide identification algorithm MS Amanda, showing its suitability for identifying peptides in high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry data and its ability to outperform widely used tools to identify peptides. Since then, we have continuously worked on improvements to enhance its usability and to support new trends and developments in this fast-growing field, while keeping the original scoring algorithm to assess the quality of a peptide spectrum match unchanged.<h4>Results</h4>We present the outcome of these efforts, MS Amanda 2.0, a faster and more flexible standalone version with the original scoring algorithm. The new implementation has led to a 3-5√ó speedup, is able to handle new ion types and supports standard data formats. We also show that MS Amanda 2.0 works best when using only the most common ion types in a particular search instead of all possible ion types.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MS Amanda is available free of charge from https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=msamanda.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

33766657,An early-morning gene network controlled by phytochromes and cryptochromes regulates photomorphogenesis pathways in Arabidopsis.,"Light perception at dawn plays a key role in coordinating multiple molecular processes and in entraining the plant circadian clock. The Arabidopsis mutant lacking the main photoreceptors, however, still shows clock entrainment, indicating that the integration of light into the morning transcriptome is not well understood. In this study, we performed a high-resolution RNA-sequencing time-series experiment, sampling every 2 min beginning at dawn. In parallel experiments, we perturbed temperature, the circadian clock, photoreceptor signaling, and chloroplast-derived light signaling. We used these data to infer a gene network that describes the gene expression dynamics after light stimulus in the morning, and then validated key edges. By sampling time points at high density, we are able to identify three light- and temperature-sensitive bursts of transcription factor activity, one of which lasts for only about 8 min. Phytochrome and cryptochrome mutants cause a delay in the transcriptional bursts at dawn, and completely remove a burst of expression in key photomorphogenesis genes (HY5 and BBX family). Our complete network is available online (http://www-users.york.ac.uk/‚àºde656/dawnBurst/dawnBurst.html). Taken together, our results show that phytochrome and cryptochrome signaling is required for fine-tuning the dawn transcriptional response to light, but separate pathways can robustly activate much of the program in their absence.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

33777034,TCRMatch: Predicting T-Cell Receptor Specificity Based on Sequence Similarity to Previously Characterized Receptors.,"The adaptive immune system in vertebrates has evolved to recognize non-self antigens, such as proteins expressed by infectious agents and mutated cancer cells. T cells play an important role in antigen recognition by expressing a diverse repertoire of antigen-specific receptors, which bind epitopes to mount targeted immune responses. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled the routine generation of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data. Identifying the specific epitopes targeted by different TCRs in these data would be valuable. To accomplish that, we took advantage of the ever-increasing number of TCRs with known epitope specificity curated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) since 2004. We compared seven metrics of sequence similarity to determine their power to predict if two TCRs have the same epitope specificity. We found that a comprehensive <i>k</i>-mer matching approach produced the best results, which we have implemented into TCRMatch, an openly accessible tool (http://tools.iedb.org/tcrmatch/) that takes TCR Œ≤-chain CDR3 sequences as an input, identifies TCRs with a match in the IEDB, and reports the specificity of each match. We anticipate that this tool will provide new insights into T cell responses captured in receptor repertoire and single cell sequencing experiments and will facilitate the development of new strategies for monitoring and treatment of infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases, as well as cancer.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,not descriptive of resource
33793824,Analysis of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium rich in internal membrane systems via gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq).,"Although regulatory small RNAs have been reported in photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the lack of clear RNA chaperones involved in their regulation poses a conundrum. Here, we analyzed the full complement of cellular RNAs and proteins using gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq) in Synechocystis 6803. Complexes with overlapping subunits such as the CpcG1-type versus the CpcL-type phycobilisomes or the PsaK1 versus PsaK2 photosystem I pre(complexes) could be distinguished, supporting the high quality of this approach. Clustering of the in-gradient distribution profiles followed by several additional criteria yielded a short list of potential RNA chaperones that include an YlxR homolog and a cyanobacterial homolog of the KhpA/B complex. The data suggest previously undetected complexes between accessory proteins and CRISPR-Cas systems, such as a Csx1-Csm6 ribonucleolytic defense complex. Moreover, the exclusive association of either RpoZ or 6S RNA with the core RNA polymerase complex and the existence of a reservoir of inactive sigma-antisigma complexes is suggested.

33794377,Identifying Novel Drug Targets by iDTPnd: A Case Study of Kinase Inhibitors.,"Current FDA-approved kinase inhibitors cause diverse adverse effects, some of which are due to the mechanism-independent effects of these drugs. Identifying these mechanism-independent interactions could improve drug safety and support drug repurposing. We have developed iDTPnd (integrated Drug Target Predictor with negative dataset), a computational approach for large-scale discovery of novel targets for known drugs. For a given drug, we construct a positive and a negative structural signature that captures the weakly conserved structural features of drug binding sites. To facilitate assessment of unintended targets, iDTPnd also provides a docking-based interaction score and its statistical significance. We were able to confirm the interaction of sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib, sunitinib, and pazopanib with their known targets at a sensitivity and specificity of 52% and 55%, respectively. We have validated 10 predicted novel targets by using in vitro experiments. Our results suggest that proteins other than kinases, such as nuclear receptors, cytochrome P450, or MHC Class I molecules can also be physiologically relevant targets of kinase inhibitors. Our method is general and broadly applicable for the identification of protein-small molecule interactions, when sufficient drug-target 3D data are available.

Objective This article aims to compare clinical outcomes and utilization data among patients with and without deafness. Design This study used a retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants The participants included Nationwide Inpatient Sample, year 2017, hospitalized adults with and without diagnostic codes related to deafness and inability to speak. Method Multiple logistic and linear regression were used to compare in-hospital outcomes. Results Thirty million four hundred one thousand one hundred seventeen adults were hospitalized, and 7,180 had deafness and inability to speak related coding. Patients with deafness were older (mean age ¬± <i>SEM</i>: 59.2 ¬± 0.51 vs. 57.9 ¬± 0.09 years, <i>p</i> = .01), and less likely female (47.0% vs. 57.7%, <i>p</i> < .01) compared to controls. Those with deafness had more comorbidities compared to the controls (Charlson comorbidity score ‚â• 3: 31.2% vs. 27.8%, <i>p</i> < .01). Mortality was higher among deaf versus controls (3.6% vs. 2.2%; <i>p</i> < .01); this translated into higher adjusted odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 1.7. [confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.4]; <i>p</i> = .01). Deaf patients had lower odds of being discharged home compared to controls {aOR} = 0.6, (CI) 0.55-0.73]; <i>p</i> < .01. Length of stay was longer (adjusted mean difference = 1.5 days CI [0.7-2.3]; <i>p</i> < .01) and hospital charges were higher, but not significantly so (adjusted mean difference = $4,193 CI [-$1,935-$10,322]; <i>p</i> = .18) in patients with deafness. Conclusions Hospitalized nonspeaking deaf patients had higher mortality and longer hospital stays compared to those without this condition. These results suggest that specialized attention may be warranted when deaf patients are admitted to our hospitals in hopes of reducing disparities in outcomes.

33823117,Exploring Parental Perspectives of Childhood Speech and Language Disorders Across 10 Countries: A Pilot Qualitative Study.,"Purpose Although researchers have explored parental perspectives of childhood speech and language disorders, most studies have been conducted in English-speaking countries. Little is known about parental experiences across countries, where procedures of language screening and services for language disorders differ. The authors participated in the COST <sup>1</sup> Action network IS1406, ""Enhancing Children's Oral Language Skills Across Europe and Beyond,"" which provided an opportunity to conduct cross-country qualitative interviews with parents. The aim of this pilot study was to explore ways in which parents construed and described speech and language disorders across countries. Method Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with parents from 10 families in 10 different countries. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The overall theme was ""acknowledging parental expertise."" The parents described, in detail, ways in which their children's speech and language (dis)abilities had an impact on the children's everyday life. Three subthemes were identified: impairment, disability, and changes over time. Conclusions The findings suggest that, across a range of countries, parents demonstrated contextualized understandings of their children's speech and language (dis)abilities, along with the everyday functional implications of the disorders. Hence, despite not holding professional knowledge about language disorders, the voices, views, understandings, and personal experiences of parents in relation to their child's disorder should be listened to when planning therapy services.

The effect of delirium in the ICU on post-hospital discharge mortality and health resource utilization is less well known.<h4>Objectives</h4>To estimate mortality and health resource utilization 2.5-years post-hospital discharge in critically ill patients admitted to ICU.<h4>Methods</h4>Population-based, propensity-score matched, retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to one of fourteen medical-surgical ICUs from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016. Delirium was measured by the 8-point Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcome was a composite measure of subsequent emergency department visits, hospital readmission, or mortality.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>There were 5,936 propensity score matched patients with and without incident delirium who survived to hospital discharge. Delirium was associated with increased mortality 0 to 30-days post-hospital discharge [Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.44 (95%CI: 1.08-1.92)]. There was no significant difference in mortality more than 30 days post-hospital discharge (delirium: 3.9%, no delirium: 2.6%). There was a persistent increased risk of emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, or mortality post-hospital discharge [HR: 1.12 (95%CI: 1.07-1.17)] throughout the study period.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ICU delirium is associated with increased mortality 0 to 30 days post-hospital discharge.

Rare, protein-altering variants in <i>AS3MT</i> could have even larger effects on AME, but their contribution to AME has not been investigated.<h4>Objectives</h4>We estimated the impact of rare, protein-coding variation in <i>AS3MT</i> on AME using a multi-population approach to facilitate the discovery of population-specific and shared causal rare variants.<h4>Methods</h4>We generated targeted DNA sequencing data for the coding regions of <i>AS3MT</i> for three arsenic-exposed cohorts with existing data on arsenic species measured in urine: Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS, n=2,434), Strong Heart Study (SHS, n=868), and New Hampshire Skin Cancer Study (NHSCS, n=666). We assessed the collective effects of rare (allele frequency <1%), protein-altering <i>AS3MT</i> variants on DMA%, using multiple approaches, including a test of the association between rare allele carrier status (yes/no) and DMA% using linear regression (adjusted for common variants in 10q24.32 region, age, sex, and population structure).<h4>Results</h4>We identified 23 carriers of rare-protein-altering <i>AS3MT</i> variant across all cohorts (13 in HEALS and 5 in both SHS and NHSCS), including 6 carriers of predicted loss-of-function variants. DMA% was 6-10% lower in carriers compared with noncarriers in HEALS [Œ≤=-9.4 (95% CI: -13.9, -4.8)], SHS [Œ≤=-6.9 (95% CI: -13.6, -0.2)], and NHSCS [Œ≤=-8.7 (95% CI: -15.6, -2.2)]. In meta-analyses across cohorts, DMA% was 8.7% lower in carriers [Œ≤=-8.7 (95% CI: -11.9, -5.4)].<h4>Discussion</h4>Rare, protein-altering variants in <i>AS3MT</i> were associated with lower mean DMA%, an indicator of reduced AME. Although a small percentage of the population (0.5-0.7%) carry these variants, they are associated with a 6-10% decrease in DMA% that is consistent across multiple ancestral and environmental backgrounds. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8152.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

In the present study, we investigated the expression of ZHX2 and its relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of GC patients, and we also examined the effect of ZHX2 overexpression in GC cell lines. We used UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu) and the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (http://cistrome.org/TIMER) to examine ZHX2 mRNA expression, and also used Kaplan-Meier Plotter (https://kmplot.com) to determine whether ZHX2 expression was related to GC prognosis. Expression of ZHX2 protein was detected using immunohistochemical staining assays. Cell proliferation was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays, whereas apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion. We also performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org) and used The Cancer Genome Atlas database (https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Cancer-Genome-Atlas) to examine the correlation of ZHX2 with immune infiltration. We report that ZHX2 is highly expressed in GC tissues and is significantly associated with clinical characteristics. Upregulation of ZHX2 predicted poor prognosis in GC. Furthermore, ZHX2 overexpression can promote the proliferation, invasion and migration, but inhibit apoptosis, of GC cells. High expression of ZHX2 in GC is correlated with the presence of infiltrating immune cells, including B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Our data suggest that high expression of ZHX2 in GC predicts poor prognosis. In addition, ZHX2 may promote malignant behaviors of GC cells, and immune infiltration might be related to the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in GC.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descriptive of resource
33840048,Rank-preserving biclustering algorithm: a case study on miRNA breast cancer.,"Effective biomarkers aid in the early diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancer and thus play an important role in the treatment of patients suffering from the disease. Growing evidence indicates that alteration of expression levels of miRNA is one of the principal causes of cancer. We analyze breast cancer miRNA data to discover a list of biclusters as well as breast cancer miRNA biomarkers which can help to understand better this critical disease and take important clinical decisions for treatment and diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a pattern-based parallel biclustering algorithm termed Rank-Preserving Biclustering (RPBic). The key strategy is to identify rank-preserved rows under a subset of columns based on a modified version of all substrings common subsequence (ALCS) framework. To illustrate the effectiveness of the RPBic algorithm, we consider synthetic datasets and show that RPBic outperforms relevant biclustering algorithms in terms of relevance and recovery. For breast cancer data, we identify 68 biclusters and establish that they have strong clinical characteristics among the samples. The differentially co-expressed miRNAs are found to be involved in KEGG cancer related pathways. Moreover, we identify frequency-based biomarkers (hsa-miR-410, hsa-miR-483-5p) and network-based biomarkers (hsa-miR-454, hsa-miR-137) which we validate to have strong connectivity with breast cancer.

The outcomes revealed that patients in the high-risk group had poorer survival than those in the low-risk group. This signature was validated in the GEO database. Further study revealed that the risk score can be an independent prognostic biomarker for LUAD. A nomogram based on the nine hub RBPs was built to quantitatively predict the prognosis of LUAD patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our nine-gene signature model could be used as a marker to predict the prognosis of LUAD and has potential for use in treatment individualization.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33854526,GeenaR: A Web Tool for Reproducible MALDI-TOF Analysis.,"Mass spectrometry is a widely applied technology with a strong impact in the proteomics field. MALDI-TOF is a combined technology in mass spectrometry with many applications in characterizing biological samples from different sources, such as the identification of cancer biomarkers, the detection of food frauds, the identification of doping substances in athletes' fluids, and so on. The massive quantity of data, in the form of mass spectra, are often biased and altered by different sources of noise. Therefore, extracting the most relevant features that characterize the samples is often challenging and requires combining several computational methods. Here, we present GeenaR, a novel web tool that provides a complete workflow for pre-processing, analyzing, visualizing, and comparing MALDI-TOF mass spectra. GeenaR is user-friendly, provides many different functionalities for the analysis of the mass spectra, and supports reproducible research since it produces a human-readable report that contains function parameters, results, and the code used for processing the mass spectra. First, we illustrate the features available in GeenaR. Then, we describe its internal structure. Finally, we prove its capabilities in analyzing oncological datasets by presenting two case studies related to ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer.

33855981,Competence assessment of the clinical tutor: a multicentric observational study.,"<h4>Background and aim of the study</h4>In the international literature there are no validated tools which investigate clinical tutors' skills. The main objective of the study has been to describe the clinical nurse tutor's skills, required to properly train nursing students during their educational path.<h4>Methods</h4>In this observational study a non-probability sampling has been used. The study was led in two centers: the AOUPR of Parma and the AUSL of Parma, after obtaining the favorable opinion from the Ethics Committee of the Northern Emilia Large Section. The data have been collected by using a structured and self-given survey that investigated three areas. Each item has a 4-point Likert scale, in which 1 indicates ""for nothing"" and 4 ""very much"". The data have been analyzed with the statistical software IBM SPSS v.26 ¬Æ and with the open-source statistical software Jamovi v.1.6.9 (https://www.jamovi.org.). The number of factors in the original model was reduced using several established research steps and then evaluated for data quality and construct validity using principal component analysis and confimatory factor analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Among 397 administered questionnaires, only 300, which were considered valid, have been filled. The psychometric properties of the investigation tool turned out to be good in all the areas analyzed with a Cronbach alpha higher than 0.70. The extensive process resulted in a version with 4 factors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Nurses' answers have allowed to draw the required profile of the clinical tutors in the different organizational contexts. The results can target possible training proposals to create opportunities for the clinical tutors.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33858322,ChIP-BIT2: a software tool to detect weak binding events using a Bayesian integration approach.,"<h4>Background</h4>ChIP-seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with sequencing and identifies genome-wide binding sites for DNA binding proteins. While many binding sites have strong ChIP-seq 'peak' observations and are well captured, there are still regions bound by proteins weakly, with a relatively low ChIP-seq signal enrichment. These weak binding sites, especially those at promoters and enhancers, are functionally important because they also regulate nearby gene expression. Yet, it remains a challenge to accurately identify weak binding sites in ChIP-seq data due to the ambiguity in differentiating these weak binding sites from the amplified background DNAs.<h4>Results</h4>ChIP-BIT2 ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/chipbitc/ ) is a software package for ChIP-seq peak detection. ChIP-BIT2 employs a mixture model integrating protein and control ChIP-seq data and predicts strong or weak protein binding sites at promoters, enhancers, or other genomic locations. For binding sites at gene promoters, ChIP-BIT2 simultaneously predicts their target genes. ChIP-BIT2 has been validated on benchmark regions and tested using large-scale ENCODE ChIP-seq data, demonstrating its high accuracy and wide applicability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ChIP-BIT2 is an efficient ChIP-seq peak caller. It provides a better lens to examine weak binding sites and can refine or extend the existing binding site collection, providing additional regulatory regions for decoding the mechanism of gene expression regulation.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
33863373,IrGO: Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology and knowledge base.,"<h4>Background</h4>Iranian traditional medicine, also known as Persian Medicine, is a holistic school of medicine with a long prolific history. It describes numerous concepts and the relationships between them. However, no unified language system has been proposed for the concepts of this medicine up to the present time. Considering the extensive terminology in the numerous textbooks written by the scholars over centuries, comprehending the totality of concepts is obviously a very challenging task. To resolve this issue, overcome the obstacles, and code the concepts in a reusable manner, constructing an ontology of the concepts of Iranian traditional medicine seems a necessity.<h4>Construction and content</h4>Makhzan al-Advieh, an encyclopedia of materia medica compiled by Mohammad Hossein Aghili Khorasani, was selected as the resource to create an ontology of the concepts used to describe medicinal substances. The steps followed to accomplish this task included (1) compiling the list of classes via examination of textbooks, and text mining the resource followed by manual review to ensure comprehensiveness of extracted terms; (2) arranging the classes in a taxonomy; (3) determining object and data properties; (4) specifying annotation properties including ID, labels (English and Persian), alternative terms, and definitions (English and Persian); (5) ontology evaluation. The ontology was created using Prot√©g√© with adherence to the principles of ontology development provided by the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) foundry.<h4>Utility and discussion</h4>The ontology was finalized with inclusion of 3521 classes, 15 properties, and 20,903 axioms in the Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology (IrGO) database, freely available at http://ir-go.net/ . An indented list and an interactive graph view using WebVOWL were used to visualize the ontology. All classes were linked to their instances in UNaProd database to create a knowledge base of ITM materia medica.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We constructed an ontology-based knowledge base of ITM concepts in the domain of materia medica to help offer a shared and common understanding of this concept, enable reuse of the knowledge, and make the assumptions explicit. This ontology will aid Persian medicine practitioners in clinical decision-making to select drugs. Extending IrGO will bridge the gap between traditional and conventional schools of medicine, helping guide future research in the process of drug discovery.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,out of scope
33877858,Developing a Flexible National Wastewater Surveillance System for COVID-19 and Beyond.,"<h4>Background</h4>Wastewater testing offers a cost-effective strategy for measuring population disease prevalence and health behaviors. For COVID-19, wastewater surveillance addresses testing gaps and provides an early warning for outbreaks. As U.S. federal agencies build a National Wastewater Surveillance System around the pandemic, thinking through ways to develop flexible frameworks for wastewater sampling, testing, and reporting can avoid unnecessary system overhauls for future infectious disease, chronic disease, and drug epidemics.<h4>Objectives</h4>We discuss ways to transform a historically academic exercise into a tool for epidemic response. We generalize lessons learned by a global network of wastewater researchers around validation and implementation for COVID-19 and opioids while also drawing on our experience with wastewater-based epidemiology in the United States.<h4>Discussion</h4>Sustainable wastewater surveillance requires coordination between health and safety officials, utilities, labs, and researchers. Adapting sampling frequency, type, and location to threat level, community vulnerability, biomarker properties, and decisions that wastewater data will inform can increase the practical value of the data. Marketplace instabilities, coupled with a fragmented testing landscape due to specialization, may require officials to engage multiple labs to test for known and unknown threats. Government funding can stabilize the market, balancing commercial pressures with public good, and incentivize data sharing. When reporting results, standardizing metrics and contextualizing wastewater data with health resource data can provide insights into a community's vulnerability and identify strategies to prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed. If wastewater data will inform policy decisions for an entire community, comparing characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant's service population to those of the larger community can help determine whether the wastewater data are generalizable. Ethical protocols may be needed to protect privacy and avoid stigmatization. With data-driven approaches to sample collection, analysis, and interpretation, officials can use wastewater surveillance for adaptive resource allocation, pandemic management, and program evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33882120,APICURON: a database to credit and acknowledge the work of biocurators.,"APICURON is an open and freely accessible resource that tracks and credits the work of biocurators across multiple participating knowledgebases. Biocuration is essential to extract knowledge from research data and make it available in a structured and standardized way to the scientific community. However, processing biological data-mainly from literature-requires a huge effort that is difficult to attribute and quantify. APICURON collects biocuration events from third-party resources and aggregates this information, spotlighting biocurator contributions. APICURON promotes biocurator engagement implementing gamification concepts like badges, medals and leaderboards and at the same time provides a monitoring service for registered resources and for biocurators themselves. APICURON adopts a data model that is flexible enough to represent and track the majority of biocuration activities. Biocurators are identified through their Open Researcher and Contributor ID. The definition of curation events, scoring systems and rules for assigning badges and medals are resource-specific and easily customizable. Registered resources can transfer curation activities on the fly through a secure and robust Application Programming Interface (API). Here, we show how simple and effective it is to connect a resource to APICURON, describing the DisProt database of intrinsically disordered proteins as a use case. We believe APICURON will provide biological knowledgebases with a service to recognize and credit the effort of their biocurators, monitor their activity and promote curator engagement.

33882829,Gene-set distance analysis (GSDA): a powerful tool for gene-set association analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Identifying sets of related genes (gene sets) that are empirically associated with a treatment or phenotype often yields valuable biological insights. Several methods effectively identify gene sets in which individual genes have simple monotonic relationships with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables. Some distance-based methods, such as distance correlations, may detect complex non-monotone associations of a gene-set with a quantitative variable that elude other methods. However, the distance correlations have yet to be generalized to associate gene-sets with categorical and censored event-time endpoints. Also, there is a need to determine which genes empirically drive the significance of an association of a gene set with an endpoint.<h4>Results</h4>We develop gene-set distance analysis (GSDA) by generalizing distance correlations to evaluate the association of a gene set with categorical and censored event-time variables. We also develop a backward elimination procedure to identify a subset of genes that empirically drive significant associations. In simulation studies, GSDA more effectively identified complex non-monotone gene-set associations than did six other published methods. In the analysis of a pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) data set, GSDA was the only method to discover that event-free survival (EFS) was associated with the 56-gene AML pathway gene-set, narrow that result down to 5 genes, and confirm the association of those 5 genes with EFS in a separate validation cohort. These results indicate that GSDA effectively identifies and characterizes complex non-monotonic gene-set associations that are missed by other methods.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GSDA is a powerful and flexible method to detect gene-set association with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables, especially to detect complex non-monotonic gene-set associations.

33890543,The latest development of the DELAD project for sharing corpora of speech disorders.,"Corpora of speech of individuals with communication disorders (CSD) are invaluable resources for education and research, but they are costly and hard to build and difficult to share for various reasons. DELAD, which means 'shared' in Swedish, is a project initiated by Professors Nicole M√ºller and Martin Ball in 2015 that aims to address this issue by establishing a platform for researchers to share datasets of speech disorders with interested audiences. To date four workshops have been held, where selected participants, covering various expertise including researchers in clinical phonetics and linguistics, speech and language therapy, infrastructure specialists, and ethics and legal specialists, participated to discuss relevant issues in setting up such an archive. Positive and steady progress has been made since 2015, including refurbishing the DELAD website (http://delad.net/) with information and application forms for researchers to join and share their datasets and linking with the CLARIN K-Centre for Atypical Communication Expertise (https://ace.ruhosting.nl/) where CSD can be hosted and accessed through the CLARIN B-Centres, The Language Archive (https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/) and TalkBank (https://talkbank.org/). The latest workshop, which was funded by CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) was held as an online event in January 2021 on topics including Data Protection Impact Assessments, reviewing changes in ethics perspectives in academia on sharing CSD, and voice conversion as a mean to pseudonomise speech. This paper reports the latest progress of DELAD and discusses the directions for further advance of the initiative, with information on how researchers can contribute to the repository.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,"databases are external, this provides an interface",not life sci
33901273,Protlego: A Python package for the analysis and design of chimeric proteins.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Duplication and recombination of protein fragments have led to the highly diverse protein space that we observe today. By mimicking this natural process, the design of protein chimeras via fragment recombination has proven experimentally successful and has opened a new era for the design of customizable proteins. The in-silico building of structural models for these chimeric proteins, however, remains a manual task that requires a considerable degree of expertise and is not amenable for high-throughput studies. Energetic and structural analysis of the designed proteins often require the use of several tools, each with their unique technical difficulties and available in different programming languages or web servers.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented a Python package that enables automated, high-throughput design of chimeras and their structural analysis. First, it fetches evolutionarily conserved fragments from a built-in database (also available at fuzzle.uni-bayreuth.de). These relationships can then be represented via networks or further selected for chimera construction via recombination. Designed chimeras or natural proteins are then scored and minimised with the Charmm and Amber forcefields and their diverse structural features can be analysed at ease. Here, we showcase Protlego's pipeline by exploring the relationships between the P-loop and Rossmann superfolds, building and characterising their offspring chimeras. We believe that Protlego provides a powerful new tool for the protein design community.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Protlego runs on the Linux platform and is freely available at (https://hoecker-lab.github.io/protlego/) with tutorials and documentation and runs on Linux OS.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
33903179,Effectiveness of intravenous r-tPA versus UK for acute ischaemic stroke: a nationwide prospective Chinese registry study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) and urokinase (UK) are both recommended for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) in China, but with few comparative outcome data being available. We aimed to compare the outcomes of these two thrombolytic agents for the treatment of patients within 4.5‚Äâhours of onset of AIS in routine clinical practice in China.<h4>Methods</h4>A pre-planned, prospective, nationwide, multicentre, real-world registry of consecutive patients with AIS (age ‚â•18 years) who received r-tPA or UK within 4.5‚Äâhours of symptom onset according to local decision-making and guideline recommendations during 2017-2019. The primary effectiveness outcome was the proportion of patients with an excellent functional outcome (defined by modified Rankin scale scores 0 to 1) at 90 days. The key safety endpoint was symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage according to standard definitions. Multivariable logistic regression was used for comparative analysis, with adjustment according to propensity scores to ensure balance in baseline characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 4130 patients with AIS were registered but 320 had incomplete or missing data, leaving 3810 with available data for analysis of whom 2666 received r-tPA (median dose 0.88 (IQR 0.78-0.90)‚Äâmg/kg) and 1144 received UK (1.71 (1.43-2.00)√ó10<sup>4</sup> international unit per kilogram). There were several significant intergroup differences in patient characteristics: r-tPA patients were more educated, had less history of stroke, lower systolic blood pressure, greater neurological impairment and shorter treatment times from symptom onset than UK patients. However, in adjusted analysis, the frequency of excellent outcome (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.40, p=0.052) and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR 0.70, 95%‚ÄâCI 0.33 to 1.47, p=0.344) were similar between groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>UK may be as effective and carry a similar safety profile as r-tPA in treating mild to moderate AIS within guidelines in China.

33906374,Genetic Causes of Cardiomyopathy in Children: First Results From the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Genes Study.,"Background Pediatric cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines recommend genetic testing in children with hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy, but practice variations exist. Robust data on clinical testing practices and diagnostic yield in children are lacking. This study aimed to identify the genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in children and to investigate clinical genetic testing practices. Methods and Results Children with familial or idiopathic cardiomyopathy were enrolled from 14 institutions in North America. Probands underwent exome sequencing. Rare sequence variants in 37 known cardiomyopathy genes were assessed for pathogenicity using consensus clinical interpretation guidelines. Of the 152 enrolled probands, 41% had a family history of cardiomyopathy. Of 81 (53%) who had undergone clinical genetic testing for cardiomyopathy before enrollment, 39 (48%) had a positive result. Genetic testing rates varied from 0% to 97% between sites. A positive family history and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype were associated with increased likelihood of genetic testing (<i>P</i>=0.005 and <i>P</i>=0.03, respectively). A molecular cause was identified in an additional 21% of the 63 children who did not undergo clinical testing, with positive results identified in both familial and idiopathic cases and across all phenotypic subtypes. Conclusions A definitive molecular genetic diagnosis can be made in a substantial proportion of children for whom the cause and heritable nature of their cardiomyopathy was previously unknown. Practice variations in genetic testing are great and should be reduced. Improvements can be made in comprehensive cardiac screening and predictive genetic testing in first-degree relatives. Overall, our results support use of routine genetic testing in cases of both familial and idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

The application identifies the most prominent gene variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) causing endometriosis using the genomic data provided for the patient by a medical expert. The present study analyzed >28.000 endometriosis‚Äërelated publications using data mining and semantic techniques aimed towards extracting the endometriosis‚Äërelated genes and SNPs. The extracted knowledge was filtered, evaluated, annotated, classified, and stored in the Demetra Application Database (DAD). Moreover, an updated gene regulatory network with the genes implements in endometriosis was established. This was followed by the design and development of the Demetra Application, in which the generated datasets and results were included. The application was tested and presented herein with whole‚Äëexome sequencing data from seven related patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis‚Äërelated SNPs and variants identified in genome‚Äëwide association studies (GWAS), whole‚Äëgenome (WGS), whole‚Äëexome (WES), or targeted sequencing information were classified, annotated and analyzed in a consolidated patient profile with clinical significance information. Probable genes associated with the patient's genomic profile were visualized using several graphs, including chromosome ideograms, statistic bars and regulatory networks through data mining studies with relative publications, in an effort to obtain a representative number of the most credible candidate genes and biological pathways associated with endometriosis. An evaluation analysis was performed on seven patients from a three‚Äëgeneration family with endometriosis. All the recognized gene variants that were previously considered to be associated with endometriosis were properly identified in the output profile per patient, and by comparing the results, novel findings emerged.

33939828,PE-Designer and PE-Analyzer: web-based design and analysis tools for CRISPR prime editing.,"Prime editing technology is capable of generating targeted insertions, deletions, and base conversions. However, the process of designing prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs), which contain a primer binding site and a reverse-transcription template at the 3' end, is more complex than that for the single guide RNAs used with CRISPR nucleases or base editors. Furthermore, the assessment of high-throughput sequencing data after prime editors (PEs) have been employed should consider the unique feature of PEs; thus, pre-existing assessment tools cannot directly be adopted for PEs. Here, we present two user-friendly web-based tools for PEs, named PE-Designer and PE-Analyzer. PE-Designer, a dedicated tool for pegRNA selection, provides all possible target sequences, pegRNA extension sequences, and nicking guide RNA sequences together with useful information, and displays the results in an interactive image. PE-Analyzer, a dedicated tool for PE outcome analysis, accepts high-throughput sequencing data, summarizes mutation-related information in a table, and provides interactive graphs.

33942461,The hop downy mildew pathogen Pseudoperonospora humuli.,"Pseudoperonospora humuli is an obligate biotrophic oomycete that causes downy mildew, one of the most devastating diseases of cultivated hop, Humulus lupulus. Downy mildew occurs in all production areas of the crop in the Northern Hemisphere and Argentina. The pathogen overwinters in hop crowns and roots, and causes considerable crop loss. Downy mildew is managed by sanitation practices, planting of resistant cultivars, and fungicide applications. However, the scarcity of sources of host resistance and fungicide resistance in pathogen populations complicates disease management. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the symptoms of the disease, life cycle, virulence factors, and management of hop downy mildew, including various forecasting systems available in the world. Additionally, recent developments in genomics and effector discovery, and the future prospects of using such resources in successful disease management are also discussed.<h4>Taxonomy</h4>Class: Oomycota; Order: Peronosporales; Family: Peronosporaceae; Genus: Pseudoperonospora; Species: Pseudoperonospora humuli.<h4>Disease symptoms</h4>The disease is characterized by systemically infected chlorotic shoots called ""spikes"". Leaf symptoms and signs include angular chlorotic lesions and profuse sporulation on the abaxial side of the leaf. Under severe disease pressure, dark brown discolouration or lesions are observed on cones. Infected crowns have brown to black streaks when cut open. Cultivars highly susceptible to crown rot may die at this phase of the disease cycle without producing shoots. However, foliar symptoms may not be present on plants with systemically infected root systems.<h4>Infection process</h4>Pathogen mycelium overwinters in buds and crowns, and emerges on infected shoots in spring. Profuse sporulation occurs on infected tissues and sporangia are released and dispersed by air currents. Under favourable conditions, sporangia germinate and produce biflagellate zoospores that infect healthy tissue, thus perpetuating the infection cycle. Though oospores are produced in infected tissues, their role in the infection cycle is not defined.<h4>Control</h4>Downy mildew on hop is managed by a combination of sanitation practices and timely fungicide applications. Forecasting systems are used to time fungicide applications for successful management of the disease.

We recorded presenting characteristics and outcomes (death or organ support) up to 30 days. We categorised patients as early DNACPR (before or on the day of admission) or late/no DNACPR (no DNACPR or occurring after the day of admission). We undertook descriptive analysis comparing these groups and multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of early DNACPR.<h4>Results</h4>We excluded 1249 with missing DNACPR data, and identified 3929/12748 (31%) with an early DNACPR decision. They had higher mortality (40.7% v 13.1%) and lower use of any organ support (11.6% v 15.7%), but received a range of organ support interventions, with some being used at rates comparable to those with late or no DNACPR (e.g. non-invasive ventilation 4.4% v 3.5%). On multivariable analysis, older age (p < 0.001), active malignancy (p < 0.001), chronic lung disease (p < 0.001), limited performance status (p < 0.001), and abnormal physiological variables were associated with increased recording of early DNACPR. Asian ethnicity was associated with reduced recording of early DNACPR (p = 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Early DNACPR decisions were associated with recognised predictors of adverse outcome, and were inversely associated with Asian ethnicity. Most people with an early DNACPR decision survived to 30 days and many received potentially life-saving interventions.<h4>Registration</h4>ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN28342533, http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN28342533.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33963730,Correlates of serum IGF-1 in young children with moderate acute malnutrition: a cross-sectional study in Burkina Faso.,"<h4>Background</h4>Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (sIGF-1) is an important growth factor in childhood. However, studies on sIGF-1 among children from low-income countries are few, and the role of body composition is unknown.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the associations of anthropometry, body composition, inflammation, and breastfeeding with sIGF-1 among children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study based on admission data from 6- to 23-mo-old children with MAM participating in a nutrition intervention trial (Treatfood) in Burkina Faso. Linear regression analysis was used to identify correlates of sIGF-1.<h4>Results</h4>Among 1546 children, the median (IQR) sIGF-1 was 12 (8.2-18.3) ng/mL. sIGF-1 was highest at 6 mo, with a nadir ‚àº10-11 mo, and higher in girls than boys. Length-for-age z score (LAZ), weight-for-length z score (WLZ), and midupper arm circumference were positively associated with sIGF-1 (P ‚â§ 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM) was also positively associated, as sIGF-1 increased 1.5 (95% CI: 0.5, 2.5) ng/mL for each 1-kg increase in FFM. However, the association disappeared after adjustment for height. Elevated serum C-reactive protein and Œ±1-acid glycoprotein were negatively associated with sIGF-1 (P ‚â§ 0.001), as was fever (P < 0.001) but not a positive malaria test per se (P = 0.15). Children never breastfed had lower sIGF-1 (-5.1; 95% CI: -9.8, -0.3).<h4>Conclusions</h4>LAZ and WLZ were positively and inflammation negatively associated with sIGF-1. As all children were moderately malnourished and many had inflammation, this probably explains the very low median sIGF-1. The association of FFM with sIGF-1 was fully explained by height. There was a marked age pattern, with a nadir in late infancy, confirming findings from smaller studies from well-nourished populations. There is a need for prospective studies to disentangle the role of sIGF-1 in growth and health. This trial was registered at https://www.isrctn.com as ISRCTN42569496.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33963869,ProteoSign v2: a faster and evolved user-friendly online tool for statistical analyses of differential proteomics.,"Bottom-up proteomics analyses have been proved over the last years to be a powerful tool in the characterization of the proteome and are crucial for understanding cellular and organism behaviour. Through differential proteomic analysis researchers can shed light on groups of proteins or individual proteins that play key roles in certain, normal or pathological conditions. However, several tools for the analysis of such complex datasets are powerful, but hard-to-use with steep learning curves. In addition, some other tools are easy to use, but are weak in terms of analytical power. Previously, we have introduced ProteoSign, a powerful, yet user-friendly open-source online platform for protein differential expression/abundance analysis designed with the end-proteomics user in mind. Part of Proteosign's power stems from the utilization of the well-established Linear Models For Microarray Data (LIMMA) methodology. Here, we present a substantial upgrade of this computational resource, called ProteoSign v2, where we introduce major improvements, also based on user feedback. The new version offers more plot options, supports additional experimental designs, analyzes updated input datasets and performs a gene enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed proteins. We also introduce the deployment of the Docker technology and significantly increase the speed of a full analysis. ProteoSign v2 is available at http://bioinformatics.med.uoc.gr/ProteoSign.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
33964156,ptm: an R package for the study of methionine sulfoxidation and other post-translational modifications.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Methionine sulfoxidation is a post-translational modification playing important roles in cell signaling. Herein, we present ptm, an R package for the study of this modification. However, since many of the analyses applied to methionine modification can be extended to other modifications, the package can be useful to thoroughly analyze post-translational modifications in general. Thus, within a single software environment ptm can integrate information from up to 11 databases covering 9 modifications. Different functions can work coordinately to form pipelines allowing the programmatic analysis of thousands of proteins. Alternatively, the user can simultaneously perform different analyses on the same protein of interest, combining the results in a single output. The flexibility of ptm makes it a suitable tool to address site- and protein-centric hypotheses related to post-translational modifications. Accompanying the package we maintain a web page containing extended documentation and examples of the tasks that can be performed with ptm.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>ptm is implemented in R. Release versions are available via CRAN and work on all major operating systems. The development version is maintained at https://bitbucket.org/jcaledo/ptm. Extended documentation can be found at https://metositeptm.com.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
33964537,Children's understanding of epilepsy: A qualitative study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To use a qualitative research approach to determine children's understandings of epilepsy and their epilepsy treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>Children aged 7-16‚ÄØyears with physician-confirmed active epilepsy (i.e., having had an epileptic seizure in the past year and or currently taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and not known to have an intellectual disability, were invited to participate. Children had semi-structured interviews separately on two occasions. Between the first and second interviews, an observation of a routine epilepsy clinic appointment of individual children was conducted, and was then discussed during the second interview. Participatory research tools were used in both child interviews to facilitate discussions. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, pseudonymized and entered into NVivo (version 12, QSR International). Data were analyzed using a thematic approach.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-three children of mean age 10.1‚ÄØyears (range 8-14), mean duration of epilepsy of 4.6‚ÄØyears (range 2-10) were enrolled. Twelve were 12 female; 7 had focal, 14 had generalized, and 2 had combined epilepsy; 20 were on monotherapy; and 16 had tried previous AEDs. All had an initial (first) interview; 20 were observed during a clinic appointment and had a second interview. Five broad themes emerged: understanding of epilepsy; understanding of seizures; understanding of medication; understanding of children's role in clinical appointments; influences on children's understanding. Children spoke about what epilepsy meant by describing the physical sensations of having a seizure or through the act of taking medication. Children described the role they had, or felt they should have, but reported challenges in being meaningfully involved in clinical appointments. While healthcare professionals were initial information nodes, epilepsy information from parents appeared to be more significant for children.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The perspectives of children with epilepsy are valuable for clinicians to understand; assumptions should not be made that children's views can be accessed via parents. Clinicians need to be constantly aware of children's views and ways of understanding and communicating about their epilepsy. To support this, the research - drawing on children's words, meanings, and stories - was used to inform an easily accessible, gender-neutral, animation about epilepsy that provides information about the condition, seizures, and medication (https://youtu.be/MO7xXL2ZXP8).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

33968730,The Immune-Related Gene HCST as a Novel Biomarker for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney tumor worldwide. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases showed that the immune-related gene (IRG) hematopoietic cell signal transducer (HCST) could provide guidance for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of ccRCC. The RNA-seq data of ccRCC tissues were extracted from two databases: TCGA (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) and GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Corresponding clinical information was downloaded from TCGA. Immune-related gene data were extracted from the IMMPORT website (https://www.immport.org/). Differential analysis with R software (https://www.r-project.org/) was used to obtain a prognosis model of ccRCC IRGs. The differences were combined with the clinical data to assess the usefulness of the HCST as a prognostic biomarker. Based on data obtained from the Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org/), Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/), and PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases, the expression levels of the HCST in ccRCC, clinical-pathological indicators of relevance, and influence on prognosis were analyzed. Regulation of the HCST gene in ccRCC was assessed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In TCGA/GEO databases, the high HCST expression in tumor tissues was significantly correlated to the TMN stage, tumor grade, invasion depth, and lymphatic metastasis (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The overall survival (OS) of patients with high HCST gene expression was significantly lower than that of patients with low HCST gene expression (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the HCST expression level [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.630, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.042-2.552], tumor cell grade (HR = 1.829, 95% CI = 1.115-3.001), and distant metastasis (HR = 2.634, 95%, CI = 1.562-4.442) were independent risk factors affecting the OS of ccRCC patients (all, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The GSEA study showed that there was significant enrichment in cell adhesion, tumorigenesis, and immune and inflammatory responses in HCST high expression samples. Hematopoietic cell signal transducer expression was closely associated with the levels of infiltrating immune cells around ccRCC tissues, especially dendritic cells (DCs). In conclusion, the present study suggested that the HCST was interrelated to the clinicopathology and poor prognosis of ccRCC. High HCST expression was also closely correlated with the levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially DCs.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descpritive of resource
33970805,Medicinal plant compounds as promising inhibitors of coronavirus (COVID-19) main protease: an <i>in silico</i> study.,"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe and has involved more than 215 countries and territories. Due to a lack of effective therapy or vaccine, urgent and concerted efforts are needed to identify therapeutic targets and medications. COVID-19 main protease represents a major target for drug treatment to inhibit viral function. The present study sought to evaluate medicinal plant compounds as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 main protease using molecular docking and molecular dynamic analysis. The PDB files of COVID-19 main protease and some medicinal plant compounds were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and Pubchem server, respectively. The Gromacs software was used for simulation studies, and molecular docking analysis was done using Autodock 4.2. The COVID-19 main protease simulation, compared with some phytochemicals docked to the COVID-19 main protease, were analyzed. Glabridin, catechin, and fisetin had the greatest tendency to interact with the COVID-19 main protease by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Docking of these phytochemicals to COVID-19 main protease led to an increase in the radius of gyration (Rg), decrease in the Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and induced variation in COVID-19 main protease secondary structure. The high tendency interaction of glabridin, catechin, and fisetin to COVID-19 main protease induced conformational changes on this enzyme. These interactions can lead to enzyme inhibition. This simulated study indicates that these phytochemicals may be considered as potent inhibitors of the viral protease; however, more investigations are required to explore their potential medicinal use.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

33970835,"""Just Engage in It or Not, You Get Out What You Put In"": Student and Staff Experiences of Feedback and Feedforward in Workplace-Based Learning Environments.","Feedback is central to student learning in the veterinary workplace. Feedforward, a related concept, is used to describe the way information about a student's performance may be used to improve their future performance. Feedback and feedforward practices are diverse, with varied student and staff understandings of the nature and purpose of feedback (feedback literacy). This study compared the practices of feedback and feedforward in a range of programs in one institution during student transitions from the classroom to workplace-based learning environments. The study adopted a broad inter-professional approach to include health care programs as well as social work and theater and performance studies. Profession-specific focus groups were conducted with contribution from 28 students and 31 staff from five different professions. Thematic analysis revealed that students and staff shared an understanding of the feedback and feedforward concepts, and both groups recognized the importance of emotional and relational aspects of the process. Students and staff across all professions recognized the impact of time constraints on the feedback process, although this was particularly highlighted in the health science professions. Social work and theater and performance studies students demonstrated a more nuanced understanding of the emotional and relational aspects of feedback and feedforward. Overall, the approach highlights similarities and differences in practices and experiences in different workplace contexts, creating opportunities for cross-disciplinary learning, which may have relevance more widely in higher education programs with workplace-based elements. The study underpinned the development of the LeapForward feedback training resource (https://bilt.online/the-leapforward-project/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not life sci
33972020,REP2: A Web Server to Detect Common Tandem Repeats in Protein Sequences.,"Ensembles of tandem repeats (TRs) in protein sequences expand rapidly to form domains well suited for interactions with proteins. For this reason, they are relatively frequent. Some TRs have known structures and therefore it is advantageous to predict their presence in a protein sequence. However, since most TRs diverge quickly, their detection by classical sequence comparison algorithms is not very accurate. Previously, we developed a method and a web server that used curated profiles and thresholds for the detection of 11 common TRs. Here we present a new web server (REP2) that allows the analysis of TRs in both individual and aligned sequences. We provide currently precomputed analyses for a selection of 78 UniProt reference proteomes. We illustrate how these data can be used to study the evolution of TRs using comparative genomics.

33980298,IDSM ChemWebRDF: SPARQLing small-molecule datasets.,"The Resource Description Framework (RDF), together with well-defined ontologies, significantly increases data interoperability and usability. The SPARQL query language was introduced to retrieve requested RDF data and to explore links between them. Among other useful features, SPARQL supports federated queries that combine multiple independent data source endpoints. This allows users to obtain insights that are not possible using only a single data source. Owing to all of these useful features, many biological and chemical databases present their data in RDF, and support SPARQL querying. In our project, we primary focused on PubChem, ChEMBL and ChEBI small-molecule datasets. These datasets are already being exported to RDF by their creators. However, none of them has an official and currently supported SPARQL endpoint. This omission makes it difficult to construct complex or federated queries that could access all of the datasets, thus underutilising the main advantage of the availability of RDF data. Our goal is to address this gap by integrating the datasets into one database called the Integrated Database of Small Molecules (IDSM) that will be accessible through a SPARQL endpoint. Beyond that, we will also focus on increasing mutual interoperability of the datasets. To realise the endpoint, we decided to implement an in-house developed SPARQL engine based on the PostgreSQL relational database for data storage. In our approach, data are stored in the traditional relational form, and the SPARQL engine translates incoming SPARQL queries into equivalent SQL queries. An important feature of the engine is that it optimises the resulting SQL queries. Together with optimisations performed by PostgreSQL, this allows efficient evaluations of SPARQL queries. The endpoint provides not only querying in the dataset, but also the compound substructure and similarity search supported by our Sachem project. Although the endpoint is accessible from an internet browser, it is mainly intended to be used for programmatic access by other services, for example as a part of federated queries. For regular users, we offer a rich web application called ChemWebRDF using the endpoint.

33981815,A spatiotemporal dataset for integrated assessment and modelling of crop-livestock integration with the MAELIA simulation platform.,"The general purpose of the primary and secondary data available in this article is to support an integrated assessment of scenarios of crop-livestock integration at the territorial level i.e. of exchanges between arable and livestock farms. The data is a result of a research collaboration between the scientist from INRAE, agricultural advisers from Chamber of Agriculture of Pays de la Loire (CRAPL) and a collective of five arable and two livestock farmers located in the district of Pays de Pouzauges (Vend√©e department, western France). All participants formed part of the DiverIMPACTS project (https://www.diverimpacts.net/) that aims to achieve the full potential of diversification of cropping systems for improved productivity, delivery of ecosystem services and resource-efficient and sustainable value chains in Europe. The first dataset corresponds to the inputs of MAELIA (http://maelia-platform.inra.fr/), a spatial agent-based simulation platform that was used to support an iterative design and assessment of scenarios to redesign cropping systems. The second dataset corresponds to the outputs of MAELIA simulations and the associated indicators at the farm, group and territory level. The data comprise multiple shape and csv files characterizing the edaphic-climatic heterogeneity of the territory and cropping systems, farmers' crop management rules (IF-THEN rules) and general information about the farms (e.g. crops, agricultural equipment, average crop yields). Data is reported for the baseline situation and three exchange scenarios containing different innovative cropping systems co-designed by scientists, agricultural advisers and the farmers. The data presented here can be found in the Portail Data INRA repository (https://doi.org/10.15454/3ZTCF5) and were used in the research article ""Fostering local crop-livestock integration via legume exchanges using an innovative integrated assessment and modelling approach: MAELIA"" [1].","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,references other db,
33982946,"Clinical Impact of Rectal Hyposensitivity: A Cross-Sectional Study of 2,876 Patients With Refractory Functional Constipation.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Normal bowel function requires intact sensory pathways. Diminished rectal sensation (rectal hyposensitivity [RH]) is associated with constipation, although its clinical importance remains unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>Consecutive patients (aged 18-80) attending a tertiary center (2004-2016) for investigation of refractory functional constipation (Rome IV core criteria defined, applied post hoc) were included. Patients completed a clinical symptom questionnaire and underwent anorectal physiologic investigations, including rectal sensory testing (balloon distension) to determine 3 well-established sensory thresholds. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between RH, symptomology, and allied physiologic investigations.<h4>Results</h4>Of 2,876 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 722 (25%) had RH based on ‚â•1 elevated sensory thresholds (0: n = 2,154 [74.9%]; 1: n = 327 [11.4%]; 2: n = 209 [7.3%]; and 3: n = 186 [6.5%]). A linear relationship existed between increasing number of elevated sensory thresholds and constipation severity (Cleveland Clinic constipation score: mean difference per threshold [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.48-0.90]; P < 0.001). Several symptoms were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with RH including: infrequent defecation (odds ratio 1.29 [1.17-1.42]), painful evacuation (1.15 [1.05-1.27]), prolonged toileting (1.14 [1.05-1.24]), and digitation or enema use (1.18 [1.08-1.30]). On defecography, a ""functional"" evacuation disorder was also associated with RH (1.37 [1.25-1.50], P < 0.001), as was megarectum (2.52 [2.08-3.05], P < 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>RH occurs in 25% of patients with refractory functional constipation. Increased number of elevated sensory thresholds is associated with more severe constipation phenotype. These data, in the largest study to date, provide for the first time evidence to show that RH is a major pathophysiologic mechanism in constipation, with recognized clinical impact (http://links.lww.com/AJG/B765).(Equation is included in full-text article.).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

It adopts the recent clade nomenclature and demonstrates the clade prediction accuracy of 92.8%. IPD 2.0 also contains a SARS-CoV-2 updater module, allowing automatic upgrading of the variant database using genome sequences from GISAID. As a proof of principle, analyzing 208,911 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we generate an extensive database of 2.58 million sample-wise variants. A comparative account of lineage-specific mutations in the newer SARS-CoV-2 strains emerging in the UK, South Africa and Brazil and data reported from India identify overlapping and lineages specific acquired mutations suggesting a repetitive convergent and adaptive evolution.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel and dynamic feature of the SARS-CoV-2 module of IPD 2.0 makes it a contemporary tool to analyze the diverse and growing genomic strains of the virus and serve as a vital tool to help facilitate rapid genomic surveillance in a population to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections.

To date, current strategies applied to control or eradicate the disease relies on diagnostic tests that suffer from limited specificity in non-vaccinated animals; while prophylactic measures, when applied, use a live attenuated bacterial strain characterized by residual virulence on adult pregnant animals and difficulties in distinguishing vaccinated from infected animals. To overcome these issues, studies are desired to elucidate the bacterial biology and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both the vaccinal strain and the pathogenic strains. Proteomics has a potential in tackling issues of One-Health concern; here, we employed label-free shotgun proteomics to investigate the protein repertoire of the vaccinal strain <i>B. melitensis</i> Rev.1 and compare it with the proteome of the <i>Brucella melitensis</i> 16 M, a reference strain representative of <i>B. melitensis</i> field strains. Comparative proteomics profiling underlines common and diverging traits between the two strains. Common features suggest the potential biochemical routes responsible for the residual virulence of the vaccinal strain, whilst the diverging traits are suggestive biochemical signatures to be further investigated to provide an optimized diagnostic capable of discriminating the vaccinated from infected animals.

The revolution in high-throughput methods has accumulated massive chromatin accessibility profiles in public repositories. Nevertheless, utilization of these data is hampered by cumbersome collection, time-consuming processing, and manual chromatin accessibility (openness) annotation of genomic regions. To fill this gap, we developed OpenAnnotate (http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/openannotate/) as the first web server for efficiently annotating openness of massive genomic regions across various biosample types, tissues, and biological systems. In addition to the annotation resource from 2729 comprehensive profiles of 614 biosample types of human and mouse, OpenAnnotate provides user-friendly functionalities, ultra-efficient calculation, real-time browsing, intuitive visualization, and elaborate application notebooks. We show its unique advantages compared to existing databases and toolkits by effectively revealing cell type-specificity, identifying regulatory elements and 3D chromatin contacts, deciphering gene functional relationships, inferring functions of transcription factors, and unprecedentedly promoting single-cell data analyses.

34000199,A Deep Learning Enhanced Novel Software Tool for Laryngeal Dynamics Analysis.,"Purpose High-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) is an emerging, but barely used, endoscopy technique in the clinic to assess and diagnose voice disorders because of the lack of dedicated software to analyze the data. HSV allows to quantify the vocal fold oscillations by segmenting the glottal area. This challenging task has been tackled by various studies; however, the proposed approaches are mostly limited and not suitable for daily clinical routine. Method We developed a user-friendly software in C# that allows the editing, motion correction, segmentation, and quantitative analysis of HSV data. We further provide pretrained deep neural networks for fully automatic glottis segmentation. Results We freely provide our software Glottis Analysis Tools (GAT). Using GAT, we provide a general threshold-based region growing platform that enables the user to analyze data from various sources, such as in vivo recordings, ex vivo recordings, and high-speed footage of artificial vocal folds. Additionally, especially for in vivo recordings, we provide three robust neural networks at various speed and quality settings to allow a fully automatic glottis segmentation needed for application by untrained personnel. GAT further evaluates video and audio data in parallel and is able to extract various features from the video data, among others the glottal area waveform, that is, the changing glottal area over time. In total, GAT provides 79 unique quantitative analysis parameters for video- and audio-based signals. Many of these parameters have already been shown to reflect voice disorders, highlighting the clinical importance and usefulness of the GAT software.

34000890,The hospital telemedicine TELEMED database: Providing information on evidence-based telemedicine services to hospital managers and healthcare professionals.,"<h4>Background</h4>Increased use of telemedicine in the healthcare system is a political goal in Denmark. Although the number of hospital patients using interventions such as the video consultation has increased in recent years only a small proportion of the outpatient and inpatient visits involve telemedicine. The TELEMED database (https://telemedicine.cimt.dk/) has been launched at the Center for Innovative Medical Technology in Denmark to ensure that hospital managers and healthcare professionals have access to information about telemedicine services and their effectiveness. This article describes the development and the content of the TELEMED database.<h4>Methods</h4>A structured literature search was made in the PubMed Database for randomised controlled trials or observational studies with a control group that investigated the effect of telemedicine interventions for hospital patients. Data were extracted from each article on the clinical effectiveness, patient perceptions, economic effects and implementation challenges. As the database should only provide inspiration to healthcare professionals regarding possibilities for use of telemedicine, the risk of bias in the studies was not assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The literature search resulted in 2825 hits. Based on full text assessment, 331 articles were included for data extraction and assessment. These articles present telemedicine services used in 22 different medical specialities. Forty-eight percent of the studies found a positive, statistically significant clinical effect, while 47% showed no statistically significant difference. In 48% of the studies, patients' experiences were examined and of these 68% found positive patient experiences. Fifty-four percent of the articles included information on the economic effects and, of these, 51% found reduction in healthcare utilization. In the majority of studies between two and four types of implementation challenges were found.<b>Conclusions and recommendations:</b> The TELEMED database provides an easily accessible overview of existing evidence-based telemedicine services for use by hospital managers and health professionals, who whish to to implement telemedicine. The database is freely available and expected to be continuously improved and broadened over time.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,"remotely related to bio, but worth considering?",out of scope
34001434,TaxonKit: A practical and efficient NCBI taxonomy toolkit.,"The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy is widely applied in biomedical and ecological studies. Typical demands include querying taxonomy identifier (TaxIds) by taxonomy names, querying complete taxonomic lineages by TaxIds, listing descendants of given TaxIds, and others. However, existed tools are either limited in functionalities or inefficient in terms of runtime. In this work, we present TaxonKit, a command-line toolkit for comprehensive and efficient manipulation of NCBI Taxonomy data. TaxonKit comprises seven core subcommands providing functions, including TaxIds querying, listing, filtering, lineage retrieving and reformatting, lowest common ancestor computation, and TaxIds change tracking. The practical functions, competitive processing performance, scalability with different scales of datasets and good accessibility could facilitate taxonomy data manipulations. TaxonKit provides free access under the permissive MIT license on GitHub, Brewsci, and Bioconda.

34004273,Klebsiella MALDI TypeR: a web-based tool for Klebsiella identification based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.,"Klebsiella pathogens affect human and animal health and are widely distributed in the environment. Among these, the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, which includes seven phylogroups, is an important cause of community and hospital infections. The Klebsiella oxytoca species complex also causes hospital infections and antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis. The unsuitability of currently used clinical microbiology methods to distinguish species within each of these species complexes leads to high rates of misidentifications that are masking the true clinical significance and potential epidemiological specificities of individual species. We developed a web-based tool, Klebsiella MALDI TypeR, a platform-independent and user-friendly application that enables uploading MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data in order to identify Klebsiella isolates at the species complex and phylogroup levels. The tool, available at https://maldityper.pasteur.fr/, leverages a database of previously identified biomarkers that are specific for species complexes, individual phylogroups, or related phylogroups. We obtained 84%-100% identification accuracy depending on phylogroup. Identification results are obtained in a few seconds from batches of uploaded spectral data. Klebsiella MALDI TypeR enables fast and reliable identification of Klebsiella strains that are often misidentified with standard microbiological methods. This web-based identification tool may be extended in the future to other human bacterial pathogens.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

We performed literature inclusion, data extraction, and trial quality evaluations. Methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook. Revman5.3 was used for all analyses.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 203 trials were identified and eleven studies involved 1094 participants aged 3-70 years. EAP was better than control group interventions in terms of effectiveness (risk ratio (RR): 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36-0.70; <i>P</i> < 0.0001). EAP was superior to sham EAP in terms of improvement of the total nasal symptom score (RR: -0.50; 95% CI: -0.96-0.05; <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03), sneezing score (RR: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.59-0.12; <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.003), global QoL score (RR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.04-0.08; <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03), and eye symptom score (RR: -0.36; 95% CI: -0.67-0.05; <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.02).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the positive results, it is premature to confirm the efficacy of EAP for treating AR.

34009014,DNA Methylation in Babies Born to Nonsmoking Mothers Exposed to Secondhand Smoke during Pregnancy: An Epigenome-Wide Association Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Maternal smoking during pregnancy is related to altered DNA methylation in infant umbilical cord blood. The extent to which low levels of smoke exposure among nonsmoking pregnant women relates to offspring DNA methylation is unknown.<h4>Objective</h4>This study sought to evaluate relationships between maternal prenatal plasma cotinine levels and DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood in newborns using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip.<h4>Methods</h4>Participants from the Newborn Epigenetics Study cohort who reported not smoking during pregnancy had verified low levels of cotinine from maternal prenatal plasma (0 ng/mL to <4‚Äâng/mL), and offspring epigenetic data from umbilical cord blood were included in this study (n=79). Multivariable linear regression models were fit to the data, controlling for cell proportions, age, race, education, and parity. Estimates represent changes in response to any 1-ng/mL unit increase in exposure.<h4>Results</h4>Multivariable linear regression models yielded 29,049 CpGs that were differentially methylated in relation to increases in cotinine at a 5% false discovery rate. Top CpGs were within or near genes involved in neuronal functioning (<i>PRKG1</i>, <i>DLGAP2</i>, <i>BSG</i>), carcinogenesis (<i>FHIT</i>, <i>HSPC157</i>) and inflammation (<i>AGER</i>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses suggest cotinine was related to methylation of gene pathways controlling neuronal signaling, metabolic regulation, cell signaling and regulation, and cancer. Further, enhancers associated with transcription start sites were enriched in altered CpGs. Using an independent sample from the same study population (n=115), bisulfite pyrosequencing was performed with infant cord blood DNA for two genes within our top 20 hits (<i>AGER</i> and <i>PRKG1</i>). Results from pyrosequencing replicated epigenome results for <i>PRKG1</i> (cg17079497, estimate=-1.09, standard error‚Äâ(SE)=0.45, p=0.018) but not for AGER (cg09199225; estimate=-0.16, SE=0.21, p=0.44).<h4>Discussion</h4>Secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmoking women may alter DNA methylation in regions involved in development, carcinogenesis, and neuronal functioning. These novel findings suggest that even low levels of smoke exposure during pregnancy may be sufficient to alter DNA methylation in distinct sites of mixed umbilical cord blood leukocytes in pathways that are known to be altered in cord blood from pregnant active smokers. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8099.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34009297,powerEQTL: An R package and shiny application for sample size and power calculation of bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed thousands of genetic loci for common diseases. One of the main challenges in the post-GWAS era is to understand the causality of the genetic variants. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is an effective way to address this question by examining the relationship between gene expression and genetic variation in a sufficiently powered cohort. However, it is frequently a challenge to determine the sample size at which a variant with a specific allele frequency will be detected to associate with gene expression with sufficient power. This is a particularly difficult task for single-cell RNAseq studies. Therefore, a user-friendly tool to estimate statistical power for eQTL analyses in both bulk tissue and single-cell data is needed. Here, we presented an R package called powerEQTL with flexible functions to estimate power, minimal sample size, or detectable minor allele frequency for both bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis. A user-friendly, program-free web application is also provided, allowing users to calculate and visualize the parameters interactively.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The powerEQTL R package source code and online tutorial are freely available at CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/powerEQTL/.

34012710,A Comparison of Methods for Studying the Tumor Microenvironment's Spatial Heterogeneity in Digital Pathology Specimens.,"<h4>Background</h4>The tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous, and it is understood to affect tumor progression and patient outcome. A number of studies have reported the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor budding in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the significance of the intratumoral heterogeneity present in the spatial distribution of these features within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) has not been previously reported. Evaluating this intratumoral heterogeneity may aid the understanding of the TIME's effect on patient prognosis as well as identify novel aggressive phenotypes which can be further investigated as potential targets for new treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we propose and apply two spatial statistical methodologies for the evaluation of the intratumor heterogeneity present in the distribution of CD3 <sup>+</sup> and CD8 <sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and tumor buds (TB) in 232 Stage II CRC cases. Getis-Ord hotspot analysis was applied to quantify the cold and hotspots, defined as regions with a significantly low or high number of each feature of interest, respectively. A novel spatial heatmap methodology for the quantification of the cold and hotspots of each feature of interest, which took into account both the interpatient heterogeneity and the intratumor heterogeneity, was further developed.<h4>Results</h4>Resultant data from each analysis, characterizing the spatial intratumor heterogeneity of lymphocytes and TBs were used for the development of two new highly prognostic risk models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results highlight the value of applying spatial statistics for the assessment of the intratumor heterogeneity. Both Getis-Ord hotspot and our proposed spatial heatmap analysis are broadly applicable across other tissue types as well as other features of interest.<h4>Availability</h4>The code underpinning this publication can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.17630/c2306fe9-66e2-4442-ad89-f986220053e2.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

It always results from exposure to drugs or environmental chemicals that cause the impairment and degeneration of the inner ear. Herein, we focused on the in silico modeling of drug-induced ototoxicity of chemicals. We collected 1,102 ototoxic medications and 1,705 non-ototoxic drugs. Based on the data set, a series of computational models were developed with different traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms implemented on an online chemical database and modeling environment. Six ML models performed best on 5-fold cross-validation and test set. A consensus model was developed with the best individual models. These models were further validated with an external validation. The consensus model showed best predictive ability, with high accuracy of 0.95 on test set and 0.90 on validation set. The consensus model and the data sets used for model development are available at https://ochem.eu/model/46566321. Besides, 16 structural alerts responsible for drug-induced ototoxicity were identified. We hope the results could provide meaningful knowledge and useful tools for ototoxicity evaluation in drug discovery and environmental risk assessment.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,dataset for the model only
34018555,MesKit: a tool kit for dissecting cancer evolution of multi-region tumor biopsies through somatic alterations.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multi-region sequencing (MRS) has been widely used to analyze intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) and cancer evolution. However, comprehensive analysis of mutational data from MRS is still challenging, necessitating complicated integration of a plethora of computational and statistical approaches.<h4>Findings</h4>Here, we present MesKit, an R/Bioconductor package that can assist in characterizing genetic ITH and tracing the evolutionary history of tumors based on somatic alterations detected by MRS. MesKit provides a wide range of analysis and visualization modules, including ITH evaluation, metastatic route inference, and mutational signature identification. In addition, MesKit implements an auto-layout algorithm to generate phylogenetic trees based on somatic mutations. The application of MesKit for 2 reported MRS datasets of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer identified known heterogeneous features and evolutionary patterns, together with potential driver events during cancer evolution.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, MesKit is useful for interpreting ITH and tracing evolutionary trajectory based on MRS data.

34019643,eVITTA: a web-based visualization and inference toolbox for transcriptome analysis.,"Transcriptome profiling is essential for gene regulation studies in development and disease. Current web-based tools enable functional characterization of transcriptome data, but most are restricted to applying gene-list-based methods to single datasets, inefficient in leveraging up-to-date and species-specific information, and limited in their visualization options. Additionally, there is no systematic way to explore data stored in the largest transcriptome repository, NCBI GEO. To fill these gaps, we have developed eVITTA (easy Visualization and Inference Toolbox for Transcriptome Analysis; https://tau.cmmt.ubc.ca/eVITTA/). eVITTA provides modules for analysis and exploration of studies published in NCBI GEO (easyGEO), detailed molecular- and systems-level functional profiling (easyGSEA), and customizable comparisons among experimental groups (easyVizR). We tested eVITTA on transcriptomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected human nasopharyngeal swab samples, and identified a downregulation of olfactory signal transducers, in line with the clinical presentation of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. We also analyzed transcriptomes of Caenorhabditis elegans worms with disrupted S-adenosylmethionine metabolism, confirming activation of innate immune responses and feedback induction of one-carbon cycle genes. Collectively, eVITTA streamlines complex computational workflows into an accessible interface, thus filling the gap of an end-to-end platform capable of capturing both broad and granular changes in human and model organism transcriptomes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

ProteinTools gathers four applications so far, namely the identification of hydrophobic clusters, hydrogen bond networks, salt bridges, and contact maps. In all cases, the input data is a PDB identifier or an uploaded structure, whereas the output is an interactive dynamic web interface. Thanks to the modular nature of ProteinTools, the addition of new applications will become an easy task.

The aim of this report is to present one potential solution to a clinical issue that of virtual and remote assessment for the purposes of spoken language research in persons with aphasia (PWA). To do so, we report detailed methods for conducting a multitimepoint (test-retest) virtual paradigm, assessing lifestyle, physiological, cognitive, and linguistic factors in persons with and without aphasia. Method Procedures for virtual assessment are detailed in a sample of adults with no brain damage (<i>N</i> = 24) and PWA (<i>N</i> = 25) on a test-retest paradigm (data collection approximately 10 ¬± 3 days apart). This report provides practical information about pre-assessment (e.g., recruitment, scheduling), assessment (e.g., aphasia-friendly consent presentation, investigator fidelity), and postassessment (e.g., data storage, quality check) procedures for human behavior research using a virtual platform. Results Preliminary study data are provided, indicating high retention rates, high rates of data acquisition, and feasibility. Common technological troubles and solutions are discussed, and solutions are offered. The results suggest that our pre-assessment, assessment, and postassessment procedures contributed to the success of our study. Conclusions We provide a practical methodology for conducting a multitimepoint study, with considerations for PWA, adding to the body of research on telehealth in clinical populations.

Lifestyle changes such as diet along with physical activity could aid in weight loss and improve cardiovascular risk factors.<h4>Objectives</h4>To investigate the effect of an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention on gut microbiota.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a substudy of the PREDIMED-Plus (Prevenci√≥n con Dieta Mediterr√°nea-Plus), a randomized controlled trial conducted in overweight/obese men and women (aged 55-75 y) with metabolic syndrome. The intervention group (IG) underwent an intensive weight loss lifestyle intervention based on an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and physical activity promotion, and the control group (CG) underwent a non-energy-restricted MedDiet for 1 y. Anthropometric, biochemical, and gut microbial 16S rRNA sequencing data were analyzed at baseline (n = 362) and 1-y follow-up (n = 343).<h4>Results</h4>IG participants had a weight loss of 4.2 (IQR, -6.8, -2.5) kg compared with 0.2 (IQR, -2.1, 1.4) kg in the CG (P < 0.001). Reductions in BMI, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and triglycerides and an increase in HDL cholesterol were greater in IG than in CG participants (P < 0.05). We observed a decrease in Butyricicoccus, Haemophilus, Ruminiclostridium 5, and Eubacterium hallii in the IG compared with the CG. Many genera shifted in the same direction within both intervention groups, indicating an overall effect of the MedDiet. Decreases in Haemophilus, Coprococcus 3, and few other genera were associated with a decrease in adiposity parameters in both intervention groups. Changes in Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 were positively associated with changes in MedDiet adherence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Weight loss induced by an energy-restricted MedDiet and physical activity induce changes in gut microbiota. The role of MedDiet-induced changes on the host might be via short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria, whereas with energy restriction, these changes might be modulated with other mechanisms, which need to be explored in future studies.

34020552,Genome-wide discovery of pre-miRNAs: comparison of recent approaches based on machine learning.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The genome-wide discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) involves identifying sequences having the highest chance of being a novel miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA), within all the possible sequences in a complete genome. The known pre-miRNAs are usually just a few in comparison to the millions of candidates that have to be analyzed. This is of particular interest in non-model species and recently sequenced genomes, where the challenge is to find potential pre-miRNAs only from the sequenced genome. The task is unfeasible without the help of computational methods, such as deep learning. However, it is still very difficult to find an accurate predictor, with a low false positive rate in this genome-wide context. Although there are many available tools, these have not been tested in realistic conditions, with sequences from whole genomes and the high class imbalance inherent to such data.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we review six recent methods for tackling this problem with machine learning. We compare the models in five genome-wide datasets: Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens. The models have been designed for the pre-miRNAs prediction task, where there is a class of interest that is significantly underrepresented (the known pre-miRNAs) with respect to a very large number of unlabeled samples. It was found that for the smaller genomes and smaller imbalances, all methods perform in a similar way. However, for larger datasets such as the H. sapiens genome, it was found that deep learning approaches using raw information from the sequences reached the best scores, achieving low numbers of false positives.<h4>Availability</h4>The source code to reproduce these results is in: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesinc/files/gwmirna Additionally, the datasets are freely available in: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesinc/files/mirdata.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34023895,LigAdvisor: a versatile and user-friendly web-platform for drug design.,"Although several tools facilitating in silico drug design are available, their results are usually difficult to integrate with publicly available information or require further processing to be fully exploited. The rational design of multi-target ligands (polypharmacology) and the repositioning of known drugs towards unmet therapeutic needs (drug repurposing) have raised increasing attention in drug discovery, although they usually require careful planning of tailored drug design strategies. Computational tools and data-driven approaches can help to reveal novel valuable opportunities in these contexts, as they enable to efficiently mine publicly available chemical, biological, clinical, and disease-related data. Based on these premises, we developed LigAdvisor, a data-driven webserver which integrates information reported in DrugBank, Protein Data Bank, UniProt, Clinical Trials and Therapeutic Target Database into an intuitive platform, to facilitate drug discovery tasks as drug repurposing, polypharmacology, target fishing and profiling. As designed, LigAdvisor enables easy integration of similarity estimation results with clinical data, thereby allowing a more efficient exploitation of information in different drug discovery contexts.

Throughout these regions, several species are used since centuries in different traditional medicinal systems, while others are used as food or food supplement. The present review attempts to critically summarize current information concerning the uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of the <i>Eriosema</i> genus and to evaluate the therapeutic potential. The information published in English and French (up to September 2020) on ethnopharmacology or traditional uses, chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of <i>Eriosema</i> genus was collected from electronic databases [SciFinder, PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Prelude Medicinal Plants-http://www.ethnopharmacologia.org/recherche-dans-prelude/?plant, The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org/), POWO (http://powo.science.kew.org/) and IUCN Red List Categories (https://www.iucnredlist.org/)], conference proceedings, books, M.Sc. and Ph.D. dissertations. The information retrieved on the ethnomedicinal indications of <i>Eriosema</i> genus allowed to list 25 species (‚àº16.6% of the genus). The majority of uses is recorded from Africa. Phytochemical analyses of 8 species led to the identification and/or isolation of 107 compounds, with flavonoids (69.2%), chromones (7.5%) and benzoic acid derivatives (3.7%) as the main chemical classes. Pharmacological investigations with crude extracts and isolated compounds showed a broad range of activities including aphrodisiac, estrogenic, anti-osteoporosis, hypolipidemic, anti-diabetic, anti-diarrheal, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anthelmintic, anti-cancer, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. Despite the low number of <i>Eriosema</i> species tested, there is convincing evidence in <i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies validating some traditional and ethnobotanical uses.

34034357,Talking about post-injury sexual functioning: The views of people with spinal cord injuries-A qualitative interview study.,"<h4>Aim</h4>This study aimed to explore perceptions of people with spinal cord injuries regarding the information they received during their rehabilitation programme on post-injury sexual functioning.<h4>Background</h4>Spinal cord injury is a traumatic, life-altering event that is associated with loss of motor and sensory function and sexual impairment. Existing evidence suggests that sexual issues are poorly handled during the rehabilitation phase of the patient's journey.<h4>Design</h4>A descriptive qualitative design was utilized in this study.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-nine people with spinal cord injury participated in qualitative in-depth interviews between November 2017 and April 2018, and data were analysed using the Burnard (1991, https://doi.org/10.1016/0260-6917(91)90009-y) thematic analysis framework.<h4>Results</h4>Some participants indicated they were sexually inactive prior to their spinal cord injury. They testified that they had not received information on post-injury sexual functioning. Many participants who received post-injury information on sexual functioning reported dissatisfaction with the content and timing of this information.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Personal conversations between spinal cord injured patients and dedicated members of the interdisciplinary health team can enhance the quality of rehabilitation care and patients' satisfaction with rehabilitation care. Nurses are central clinicians in the rehabilitation programme of spinal cord injured patients and should engage in individually designed conversations about post-injury sexual functioning.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34037798,CPA: a web-based platform for consensus pathway analysis and interactive visualization.,"In molecular biology and genetics, there is a large gap between the ease of data collection and our ability to extract knowledge from these data. Contributing to this gap is the fact that living organisms are complex systems whose emerging phenotypes are the results of multiple complex interactions taking place on various pathways. This demands powerful yet user-friendly pathway analysis tools to translate the now abundant high-throughput data into a better understanding of the underlying biological phenomena. Here we introduce Consensus Pathway Analysis (CPA), a web-based platform that allows researchers to (i) perform pathway analysis using eight established methods (GSEA, GSA, FGSEA, PADOG, Impact Analysis, ORA/Webgestalt, KS-test, Wilcox-test), (ii) perform meta-analysis of multiple datasets, (iii) combine methods and datasets to accurately identify the impacted pathways underlying the studied condition and (iv) interactively explore impacted pathways, and browse relationships between pathways and genes. The platform supports three types of input: (i) a list of differentially expressed genes, (ii) genes and fold changes and (iii) an expression matrix. It also allows users to import data from NCBI GEO. The CPA platform currently supports the analysis of multiple organisms using KEGG and Gene Ontology, and it is freely available at http://cpa.tinnguyen-lab.com.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
34038112,CyProduct: A Software Tool for Accurately Predicting the Byproducts of Human Cytochrome P450 Metabolism.,"<i>In silico</i> metabolism prediction is a cheminformatic task of autonomously predicting the set of metabolic byproducts produced from a specified molecule and a set of enzymes or reactions. Here, we describe a novel machine learned <i>in silico</i> cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolism prediction suite, called CyProduct, that accurately predicts metabolic byproducts for a specified molecule and a human CYP450 isoform. It includes three modules: (1) CypReact, a tool that predicts if the query compound reacts with a given CYP450 enzyme, (2) CypBoM, a tool that accurately predicts the ""bond site"" of the reaction (i.e., which specific bonds within the query molecule react with the CYP isoform), and (3) MetaboGen, a tool that generates the metabolic byproducts based on CypBoM's bond-site prediction. CyProduct predicts metabolic biotransformation products for each of the nine most important human CYP450 enzymes. CypBoM uses an important new concept called ""bond of metabolism"" (BoM), which extends the traditional ""site of metabolism"" (SoM) by specifying the information about the set of chemical <i>bonds</i> that is modified or formed in a metabolic reaction (rather than the specific atom). We created a BoM database for 1845 CYP450-mediated Phase I reactions, then used this to train the CypBoM Predictor to predict the reactive bond locations on substrate molecules. CypBoM Predictor's cross-validated Jaccard score for reactive bond prediction ranged from 0.380 to 0.452 over the nine CYP450 enzymes. Over variants of a test set of 68 known CYP450 substrates and 30 nonreactants, CyProduct outperformed the other packages, including ADMET Predictor, BioTransformer, and GLORY, by an average of 200% (with respect to Jaccard score) in terms of predicting metabolites. The CyProduct suite and the data sets are freely available at https://bitbucket.org/wishartlab/cyproduct/src/master/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
34038548,Estimage: a webserver hub for the computation of methylation age.,"Methylage is an epigenetic marker of biological age that exploits the correlation between the methylation state of specific CG dinucleotides (CpGs) and chronological age (in years), gestational age (in weeks), cellular age (in cell cycles or as telomere length, in kilobases). Using DNA methylation data, methylage is measurable via the so called epigenetic clocks. Importantly, alterations of the correlation between methylage and age (age acceleration or deceleration) have been stably associated with pathological states and occur long before clinical signs of diseases become overt, making epigenetic clocks a potentially disruptive tool in preventive, diagnostic and also in forensic applications. Nevertheless, methylage dependency from CpGs selection, mathematical modelling, tissue specificity and age range, still makes the potential of this biomarker limited. In order to enhance model comparisons, interchange, availability, robustness and standardization, we organized a selected set of clocks within a hub webservice, EstimAge (Estimate of methylation Age, http://estimage.iac.rm.cnr.it), which intuitively and informatively enables quick identification, computation and comparison of available clocks, with the support of standard statistics.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
34039904,Low Referral Rates for Genetic Assessment of Patients with Multiple Adenomas in United Kingdom Bowel Cancer Screening Programs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Approximately one in twenty cases of colorectal cancer are caused by monogenic syndromes. Published guidelines recommend that patients with ten or more adenomas be referred for genetic testing, based on evidence that colorectal cancer risk is associated with adenoma multiplicity.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to determine adherence to guidelines on referral for genetic screening in patients with ten or more adenomas.<h4>Design</h4>A cross-sectional study was performed of prospectively collected data from the United Kingdom Bowel Cancer Screening Program between May 2007 and June 2018. Only histologically confirmed adenomas were included. Clinicopathological data were recorded from patient records and referrals to clinical genetics services were ascertained.<h4>Setting</h4>Data were obtained from three centers in London, United Kingdom.<h4>Patients</h4>A total of 17,450 subjects underwent colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal occult blood test.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>We quantified patients with ten or more adenomas and the proportion referred for genetic screening.<h4>Results</h4>The adenoma detection rate was 50.6% amongst 17,450 patients who underwent colonoscopy (8,831 had one or more adenomas). 347 patients (2.0%) had 10 or more adenomas. Patients with 10 or more adenomas were more likely to be male than those with less than 10 adenomas (76.9% vs. 53.4%; p<0.0001). A family history was collected in 37.8% of the multiple adenoma population. Of 347 patients with 10 or more adenomas, 28 (8.1%) were referred for genetic assessment.<h4>Limitations</h4>All three screening centers were in a single city. No genetic outcome data were available to permit analysis of actual rates of inherited cancer syndromes in this population.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, almost one in fifty patients had ten or more adenomas. Despite guidelines advising genetic testing in this group, referral rates are low. A referral pathway and management strategies should be established to address this patient population.

34040621,Easymap: A User-Friendly Software Package for Rapid Mapping-by-Sequencing of Point Mutations and Large Insertions.,"Mapping-by-sequencing strategies combine next-generation sequencing (NGS) with classical linkage analysis, allowing rapid identification of the causal mutations of the phenotypes exhibited by mutants isolated in a genetic screen. Computer programs that analyze NGS data obtained from a mapping population of individuals derived from a mutant of interest to identify a causal mutation are available; however, the installation and usage of such programs requires bioinformatic skills, modifying or combining pieces of existing software, or purchasing licenses. To ease this process, we developed Easymap, an open-source program that simplifies the data analysis workflows from raw NGS reads to candidate mutations. Easymap can perform bulked segregant mapping of point mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) with DNA-seq or RNA-seq datasets, as well as tagged-sequence mapping for large insertions, such as transposons or T-DNAs. The mapping analyses implemented in Easymap have been validated with experimental and simulated datasets from different plant and animal model species. Easymap was designed to be accessible to all users regardless of their bioinformatics skills by implementing a user-friendly graphical interface, a simple universal installation script, and detailed mapping reports, including informative images and complementary data for assessment of the mapping results. Easymap is available at http://genetics.edu.umh.es/resources/easymap; its Quickstart Installation Guide details the recommended procedure for installation.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

We then reanalyze data (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ4,244) previously examined by Richardson et al. (Evolutionary Psychology, 15(1), 2017, https://doi.org/10.1177/1474704916666840 to determine whether (a) previously reported evidence of multidimensionality is robust to the modeling approach employed and (b) the structure of LH indicators is invariant by sex. Findings provide further evidence that a single LH dimension is implausible and that researchers should cease interpreting K-factor scores as empirical proxies for LH speed. In contrast to the original study, we detected a small inverse correlation between mating competition and Super-K that is consistent with a trade-off. Tests of measurement invariance across the sexes revealed evidence of metric invariance (i.e., equivalence of factor loadings), consistent with the theory that K is a proximate cause of its indicators; however, evidence of partial scalar invariance suggests use of scores likely introduces bias when the sexes are compared. We discuss limitations and identify approaches that researchers may use to further evaluate the validity of the K-factor and other applications of LH to human variation.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Atomistic structural details of protein-protein interactions may provide important information that can facilitate the design of therapeutic agents. GalaxyHeteromer is a freely available automatic web server (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/heteromer) that predicts protein heterodimer complex structures from two subunit protein sequences or structures. When subunit structures are unavailable, they are predicted by template- or distance-prediction-based modelling methods. Heterodimer complex structures can be predicted by both template-based and ab initio docking, depending on the template's availability. Structural templates are detected from the protein structure database based on both the sequence and structure similarities. The templates for heterodimers may be selected from monomer and homo-oligomer structures, as well as from hetero-oligomers, owing to the evolutionary relationships of heterodimers with domains of monomers or subunits of homo-oligomers. In addition, the server employs one of the best ab initio docking methods when heterodimer templates are unavailable. The multiple heterodimer structure models and the associated scores, which are provided by the web server, may be further examined by user to test or develop functional hypotheses or to design new functional molecules.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

34058399,BA-plotteR - A web tool for generating Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement.,"Investigators use Bland-Altman plot (Limits of Agreement plot) to compare two methods measuring the same continuous variable to determine interchangeability or agreement of the methods. The method has evolved to deal with heteroscedastic data and fixed or proportional biases (or both). Although an ordinary Bland-Altman plot can be readily made with various software applications, there is no free, open-source application that is dedicated to producing Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement for data that do not meet the assumptions of a simple comparison. To fill this gap, we created BA-plotteR, a web-based, open-source, freeware tool created in Shiny/R that is dedicated to creating Bland-Altman plots. We validated the tool using 20 datasets with various data distributions by comparing the output from the tool against manually derived results. The webtool handles data that requires a more complex analysis than is commonly available through commercial statistical programs. Moreover, the automated analysis of the data distribution will guide users and help them to correctly plot and analyse their data. The tool agreed perfectly with manually constructed plots. The Bland-Altman graphing tool provides clinical researchers with a tool that correctly analyzes and graphs studies involved in method comparisons.

34058973,GLEANER: a web server for GermLine cycle Expression ANalysis and Epigenetic Roadmap visualization.,"<h4>Background</h4>Germline cells are important carriers of genetic and epigenetic information transmitted across generations in mammals. During the mammalian germline cell development cycle (i.e., the germline cycle), cell potency changes cyclically, accompanied by dynamic transcriptional changes and epigenetic reprogramming. Recently, to understand these dynamic and regulatory mechanisms, multiomic analyses, including transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications of germline cells, have been performed for different stages in human and mouse germline cycles. However, the long time span of the germline cycle and material scarcity of germline cells have largely limited the understanding of these dynamic characteristic changes. A tool that integrates the existing multiomics data and visualizes the overall continuous dynamic trends in the germline cycle can partially overcome such limitations.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present GLEANER, a web server for GermLine cycle Expression ANalysis and Epigenetics Roadmap visualization. GLEANER provides a comprehensive collection of the transcriptome, DNA methylome, chromatin accessibility, and H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 histone modification characteristics in human and mouse germline cycles. For each input gene, GLEANER shows the integrative analysis results of its transcriptional and epigenetic features, the genes with correlated transcriptional changes, and the overall continuous dynamic trends in the germline cycle. We further used two case studies to demonstrate the detailed functionality of GLEANER and highlighted that it can provide valuable clues to the epigenetic regulation mechanisms in the genetic and epigenetic information transmitted during the germline cycle.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To the best of our knowledge, GLEANER is the first web server dedicated to the analysis and visualization of multiomics data related to the mammalian germline cycle.

34074827,Influence of Sedation on the Detection Rate of Early Cancer and Precancerous Lesions During Diagnostic Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopies: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>The influence of sedation on the endoscopic detection rate of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) early cancer (EC) and precancerous lesions, including high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) and low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, has not been assessed. The aim of this research is to assess whether the use of sedation can help improve the detection rate of UGI EC and precancerous lesions. The second objective is to evaluate its potential influencing factors.<h4>Methods</h4>The study includes 432,202 patients from a multicenter database from January 2012 to July 2019. Information on endoscopic findings and histology biopsies was obtained from endoscopy quality-control system. Associations of sedation with the detection rate of EC and precancerous lesions were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The sedation group has a higher detection rate of UGI EC and HGIN compared with the no-sedation group, whereas the detection rate of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia was similar between the 2 groups. There were more cases examined by using staining, image enhancement, or magnifying techniques in the sedation group (P < 0.001). And, the mean observation time was also longer in the sedation group (P < 0.001). The type 0-IIb esophageal HGIN and EC cases were significantly increased in the sedation group. No significant difference was detected on lesion subtypes for gastric HGIN and EC according to the Paris classification. More gastric HGIN and EC were detected at gastric body in the sedation group (P = 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>Sedation may improve the endoscopic detection rate of EC and HGIN in the UGI tract probably through enhancing the use of accessary endoscopic techniques, prolonging observation time, and taking more biopsies in different locations (see Visual Abstract, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B926).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

In a secondary analysis of randomized trial data, the authors compared the efficacy of the PREPARE for Your Care (PREPARE) website plus an easy-to-read advance directive (AD) with an AD only among older adults with and without cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Safety net, primary care patients in San Francisco were included if they were 55 years old or older, were English- or Spanish-speaking, and had 2 or more chronic conditions. The authors determined cancer diagnoses by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/Tenth Revision codes. The primary outcome was new ACP documentation in the medical record at 15 months; the secondary outcomes were self-reported ACP engagement, ease of use, satisfaction, and depression/anxiety. The authors used mixed effects logistic and linear regression adjusted for prior ACP, health literacy, and clinician, including a cancer interaction term.<h4>Results</h4>Of 986 participants, 220 (22%) had cancer. The mean age was 63 years (SD, 6 years), 61% were women, 81% were of a minority race/ethnicity, 45% were Spanish-speaking, 39% had limited health literacy, and 27% had prior ACP. New ACP documentation was higher in the PREPARE arm versus the AD-only arm among participants with cancer (62% vs 43%; P = .01) and without cancer (38% vs 28%; P = .01), as was ACP engagement in both arms (P < .001), with no interactions by cancer. Ease of use and satisfaction were high, and depression/anxiety was low, with no differences by study arm or by cancer/no cancer.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PREPARE plus an easy-to-read AD increased ACP documentation and engagement among diverse older adults with cancer more than an AD alone, with no increase in depression or anxiety between study arms or by cancer. PREPARE may help to decrease ACP disparities among patients with cancer.<h4>Lay summary</h4>Advance care planning (ACP) is the process of sharing values, goals, and preferences for medical care, but engagement in ACP is low among older adults with cancer. Among 986 English- and Spanish-speaking older adults from a safety net hospital, an interactive, multimedia, web-based ACP program (PREPARE for Your Care at https://prepareforyourcare.org/) plus an easy-to-read advance directive increased ACP documentation and engagement more than an advance directive alone. There were no differences in this increase in ACP between older adults with cancer and older adults without cancer.

34085565,Patterns of Nutrient Intake in Relation to Gastric Cancer: A Case Control Study.,"Gastric Cancer (GC) is the most common cancer among Iranian men. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between patterns of nutrient intake and the risk of GC in Iran. We enrolled 178 GC patients and 271 controls matched for age and sex. We collected dietary intakes using a validated diet history questionnaire. We performed factor analysis on 28 nutrients using multivariate logistic regression models on tertiles of factor scores and estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We identified three nutrient patterns. The first pattern included pantothenic acid, riboflavin, zinc, animal protein, and calcium. Selenium, thiamin, carbohydrate, vegetable protein, niacin and low intake of vitamin E loaded the second pattern, and the third pattern was abundant in fiber, carotene, vitamin C and A. We found no significant association between GC and any of the dietary patterns. However, in the first patterns, men in the highest tertile had significantly higher odds of GC than the lowest (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.13-4.09, p trend = 0.02). A dietary pattern loaded by animal products may increase the risk of GC among Iranian men.

Yet, the field of next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis for microorganisms (including multiple pathogens) remains fragmented, lacks accessible and reusable tools, is hindered by local computational resource limitations, and does not offer widely accepted standards. One such ""problem areas"" is the analysis of Transposon Insertion Sequencing (TIS) data. TIS allows probing of almost the entire genome of a microorganism by introducing random insertions of transposon-derived constructs. The impact of the insertions on the survival and growth under specific conditions provides precise information about genes affecting specific phenotypic characteristics. A wide array of tools has been developed to analyze TIS data. Among the variety of options available, it is often difficult to identify which one can provide a reliable and reproducible analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Here we sought to understand the challenges and propose reliable practices for the analysis of TIS experiments. Using data from two recent TIS studies, we have developed a series of workflows that include multiple tools for data de-multiplexing, promoter sequence identification, transposon flank alignment, and read count repartition across the genome. Particular attention was paid to quality control procedures, such as determining the optimal tool parameters for the analysis and removal of contamination.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our work provides an assessment of the currently available tools for TIS data analysis. It offers ready to use workflows that can be invoked by anyone in the world using our public Galaxy platform ( https://usegalaxy.org ).

RESULTS The results of questionnaire and data analysis showed that the overall level of transcultural adaptation of Tibetan trainee nurses was that the number of people with poor adaptation was slightly higher than those with good adaptation, and most Tibetan trainee nurses were in the middle level. Meanwhile, sociocultural adaptation was better than psychological adaptation. There were no statistically significant differences among the 4 grouping variables: gender, student home region, the city where the internship hospital was located, and whether they were from a single-child family or not. CONCLUSIONS The results revealed that there was still transcultural maladjustment among Tibetan nurses in the internship stage, and the psychological maladjustment was more obvious than the sociocultural maladjustment. We provide countermeasures and suggestions to solve the problems of transcultural adaptation reflected in the research.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34096110,'What matters to you?'-a qualitative study on the views of nursing home residents with dementia regarding the health care they receive.,"<h4>Aims and objective</h4>This study's aim is to examine what matters to nursing home residents with dementia by exploring their perceptions of nursing home health care through the conceptual lens of person-centred care.<h4>Background</h4>Dementia is a major contributor to nursing home placement. To understand the meaning of living with dementia, the inclusion of persons with dementia in research studies is essential.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 35 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with people who have dementia and live in nursing homes. A thematic analysis was applied to analyse the data. Checklist for qualitative studies: Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/coreq/ RESULTS: The analysis revealed one overarching theme with four sub-themes. Different matchings of person-centred care and routines in health care being the overarching theme. The four sub-themes were as follows: (a) understanding of the interplay between disabilities and ageing; (b) participating based on one's own preferences and needs; (c) incongruence between the person with dementia's preferences and needs and health-care support; and (d) working conditions: the relationship between residents and health-care providers. Despite the substantive focus of researchers on person-centred care and the positive impact on the nursing home health care of those who receive it, the results showed that nursing home residents still want more person-centred care.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results indicate that the incongruence between general routines and individual preferences and needs, as well as the demand to operationalise the person-centred dimensions of health-care behaviour in nursing homes, must be resolved. Health care in nursing homes must focus on enabling residents to participate in daily activities and sustain their personhood and sense of self.<h4>Relevance to clinical practice</h4>Based on the residents' statements, the results contribute to the fields of dementia education, health-care provision and policy-making and may be used to achieve person-centredness and governance.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34096320,Treated HIV Infection and Progression of Carotid Atherosclerosis in Rural Uganda: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study.,"Background Although ‚âà70% of the world's population of people living with HIV reside in sub-Saharan Africa, there are minimal prospective data on the contributions of HIV infection to atherosclerosis in the region. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy >40 years of age in rural Uganda, along with population-based comparators not infected with HIV. We collected data on cardiovascular disease risk factors and carotid ultrasound measurements annually. We fitted linear mixed effects models, adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors, to estimate the association between HIV serostatus and progression of carotid intima media thickness (cIMT). We enrolled 155 people living with HIV and 154 individuals not infected with HIV and collected cIMT images at 1045 visits during a median of 4 annual visits per participant (interquartile range 3-4, range 1-5). Age (median 50.9 years) and sex (49% female) were similar by HIV serostatus. At enrollment, there was no difference in mean cIMT by HIV serostatus (0.665 versus 0.680 mm, <i>P</i>=0.15). In multivariable models, increasing age, blood pressure, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with greater cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05), however change in cIMT per year was also no different by HIV serostatus (0.004 mm/year for HIV negative [95% CI, 0.001-0.007 mm], 0.006 mm/year for people living with HIV [95% CI, 0.003-0.008 mm], HIV√ótime interaction <i>P</i>=0.25). Conclusions In rural Uganda, treated HIV infection was not associated with faster cIMT progression. These results do not support classification of treated HIV infection as a risk factor for subclinical atherosclerosis progression in rural sub-Saharan Africa.

34122055,Impact of Total Epinephrine Dose on Long Term Neurological Outcome for Cardiac Arrest Patients: A Cohort Study.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Although epinephrine is universally acknowledged to increase return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest, its balanced effects on later outcomes remain uncertain, causing potential harm during post-resuscitation phase. Recent studies have questioned the efficacy and potential deleterious effects of epinephrine on long-term survival and neurological outcomes, despite that the adverse relationship between epinephrine dose and outcome can be partially biased by longer CPR duration and underlying comorbidities. This study explored the long-term effect of epinephrine when used in a cohort of patients that underwent cardiac arrest during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. <b>Methods:</b> The data were originally collected from a retrospective institutional database from January 2007 to December 2015 and are now available on Dryad (via: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qv6fp83). Use of epinephrine was coded by dose (<2 mg, 2 mg, 3-4 mg, ‚â•5 mg). A favorable neurological outcome was defined using a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 or 2. The association between epinephrine dosing and 3-months neurological outcome was analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated a negative association between total epinephrine dose and neurological outcome. Of the 373 eligible patients, 92 received less than 2 mg of epinephrine, 60 received 2 mg, 97 received 3-4 mg and 124 received more than 5 mg. Compared to patients who received less than 2 mg of epinephrine, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of a favorable neurological outcome was 0.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-1.68) for 2 mg of epinephrine, 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.89) for 3-4 mg of epinephrine and 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.96) for more than 5 mg of epinephrine. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this cohort of patients who achieved ROSC, total epinephrine dosing during resuscitation was associated with a worse neurological outcome three months after cardiac arrest, after adjusting other confounding factors. Further researches are needed to investigate the long-term effect of epinephrine on cardiac arrest patients.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34122523,Development and Validation of a Hypoxia-Related Signature for Predicting Survival Outcomes in Patients With Bladder Cancer.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to develop and validate a hypoxia signature for predicting survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded the RNA sequence and the clinicopathologic data of the patients with bladder cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) databases. Hypoxia genes were retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). Differentially expressed hypoxia-related genes were screened by univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso regression analysis. Then, the selected genes constituted the hypoxia signature and were included in multivariate Cox regression to generate the risk scores. After that, we evaluate the predictive performance of this signature by multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The CIBERSORT tool was applied to investigate the relationship between the hypoxia signature and the immune cell infiltration, and the maftool was used to summarize and analyze the mutational data. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the related signaling pathways of differentially expressed genes in both risk groups. Furthermore, we developed a model and presented it with a nomogram to predict survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Results</h4>Eight genes (AKAP12, ALDOB, CASP6, DTNA, HS3ST1, JUN, KDELR3, and STC1) were included in the hypoxia signature. The patients with higher risk scores showed worse overall survival time than the ones with lower risk scores in the training set (TCGA) and two external validation sets (GSE13507 and GSE32548). Immune infiltration analysis showed that two types of immune cells (M0 and M1 macrophages) had a significant infiltration in the high-risk group. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) analysis showed that the risk scores between the wild types and the mutation types of TP53, MUC16, RB1, and FGFR3 were significantly different. Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that immune or cancer-associated pathways belonged to the high-risk groups and metabolism-related signal pathways were enriched into the low-risk group. Finally, we constructed a predictive model with risk score, age, and stage and validated its performance in GEO datasets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We successfully constructed and validated a novel hypoxia signature in bladder cancer, which could accurately predict patients' prognosis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

34124628,Uncovering transmission patterns of COVID-19 outbreaks: A region-wide comprehensive retrospective study in Hong Kong.,"<h4>Background</h4>Given the dynamism and heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission patterns, determining the most effective yet timely strategies for specific regions remains a severe challenge for public health decision-makers.<h4>Methods</h4>In this work, we proposed a spatiotemporal connectivity analysis method for discovering transmission patterns across geographic locations and age-groups throughout different COVID-19 outbreak phases. First, we constructed the transmission networks of the confirmed cases during different phases by considering the spatiotemporal connectivity of any two cases. Then, for each case and those cases immediately pointed from it, we characterized the corresponding cross-district/population transmission pattern by counting their district-to-district and age-to-age occurrences. By summating the cross-district/population transmission patterns of all cases during a given period, we obtained the aggregated cross-district and cross-population transmission patterns.<h4>Findings</h4>We conducted a region-wide comprehensive retrospective study in Hong Kong based on the complete data report of COVID-19 cases, covering all 18 districts between January 23, 2020, and January 8, 2021 (https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dh-chpsebcddr-novel-infectious-agent). The spatiotemporal connectivity analysis clearly unveiled the quantitative differences among various outbreak waves in their transmission scales, durations, and patterns. Moreover, for the statistically similar waves, their cross-district/population transmission patterns could be quite different (e.g., the cross-district transmission of the fourth wave was more diverse than that of the third wave, while the transmission over age-groups of the fourth wave was more concentrated than that of the third wave). At an overall level, super-spreader individuals (highly connected cases in the transmission networks) were usually concentrated in only a few districts (2 out of 18 in our study) or age-groups (3 out of 11 in our study).<h4>Interpretation</h4>With the discovered cross-district or cross-population transmission patterns, all of the waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in Hong Kong can be systematically scrutinized. Among all districts, quite a few (e.g., the Yau Tsim Mong district) were instrumental in spreading the virus throughout the pandemic. Aside from being exceptionally densely populated, these districts were also social-economic centers. With a variety of situated public venues, such as restaurants and singing/dancing clubs, these districts played host to all kinds of social gathering events, thereby providing opportunities for widespread and rapid transmission of the virus. Thus, these districts should be given the highest priority when deploying district-specific social distancing or intervention strategies, such as lockdown and stringent mandatory coronavirus testing for identifying and obstructing the chain of transmission. We also observed that most of the reported cases and the highly connected cases were middle-aged and elderly people (40- to 69-year-olds). People in these age-groups were active in various public places and social activities, and thus had high chances of being infected by or infecting others.<h4>Funding</h4>General research fund of the Hong Kong research grants council.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34126844,Incidence and prevalence of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (functional seizures): a systematic review and an analytical study.,"<h4>Aim</h4>Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) or functional seizures are universal phenomena. However, data on their epidemiology is limited. The aim of the current study was to review the literature on the epidemiology of PNES and to provide analytical estimates of its incidence and prevalence based on the direct data that are available from previous studies on PNES.<h4>Methods</h4>The methods of this work had two parts: (1) MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus from inception to 19 October 2019 were systematically searched. (2) The analytical study of the incidence and prevalence of PNES was performed, based on the following data from previous studies: incidence of PNES, duration of PNES before making a diagnosis, outcome and mortality of PNES.<h4>Results</h4>The search strategy yielded five articles; three were on the incidence and two on the prevalence. In the analytical part of the study, the incidence of PNES was calculated to be 3.1 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.1-5.1) per 100,000 population per year. The calculated prevalence rate of PNES in 2019 was 108.5 (95% Confidence Interval: 39.2-177.8) per 100,000 population, in the USA.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While, the generalizability of these calculated incidence and prevalence rates to other places in the world is limited, they give us a reasonable hint that PNES is a common condition and the prevalence is much more than that it was thought before.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1942870.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

34133393,Evaluation of Bowel Function after Surgical Treatment for Intestinal Endometriosis: A Prospective Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Defecation symptoms related to intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis are considered to be caused by anatomical and functional disorders, and are likely linked to the course of the disease and surgical treatment.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary aim of this study was to assess bowel function before and after intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis surgery. Secondarily, we sought to correlate defecatory symptoms with preoperative risk factors.<h4>Design/settings</h4>This is a single center prospective cohort study, using the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score to evaluate bowel function 4 weeks before, as well as at 6 months and one year after surgery. Wilcoxon signed rank test and logistic multiple regression analyses were performed to compare preoperative and postoperative scores. For all of the comparisons, the level of significance was set at <0.05.<h4>Patients</h4>Thirty-seven adult female patients who underwent intestinal resection for deep infiltrative endometriosis between 2015 and 2017 were included.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The primary outcome was bowel function appraisement in deep infiltrative endometriosis intestinal surgery.<h4>Results</h4>During the preoperative evaluation, 48.6% of patients reported Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score ‚â•21. This group presented a mean score of 17.9 ¬± 13.7, with a median of 20 and a range of 5 - 30. After one year, the mean score was decreased to 9.6 ¬± 11.1, with a median of 4 and a range of 0 - 22. A significant difference was detected when comparing the post- and preoperative scores (p=0.0006). It was also reported improvements in defecatory symptoms such as reduced fecal incontinence for flatus (p= 0.004) and liquid stools (p=0.014). The clustering of stools (p=0.005) and fecal urgency (p=0.001) also improved one year after surgery. The preoperative multiple logistic regression showed that dyschezia was the only independent variable associated with bowel symptoms.<h4>Limitations</h4>Despite it is a well-documented prospective study the data presented has a relatively small population.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides evidence that intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis surgery improves bowel function and has a positive impact on evacuation symptoms.

34142845,"First report of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris as the causal agent of necrotic leaf spot in Phaseolus vulgaris at Puebla, Mexico.","Beans are the most cultivated legume in the world. In Mexico, it is the second most important crop after corn (FAO 2020; SIAP 2020). Bean plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety were affected by a foliar disease during the agricultural cycle 2019 in Puebla-Mexico (19¬∞02'46.6"" LN and 98¬∞05'15.6"" LO). Necrotic V- shaped lesions were observed on the margins of the leaves surrounded by yellow halos followed by foliar necrosis, affecting 40% of the crop. In Mexico this variety of cultivars is in great demand for local consumption and generates income in foreign currency (Castellanos et al. 1997). Sampling was carried out on 50 plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety, with necrotic leaf symptoms from ten plots of one hectare. Samples were cut into pieces (5 mm), disinfested with 1% hypochlorite 3 min, and washed with sterile distilled water. Subsequently, samples were dried on sterile paper and placed on Petri plates containing yeast extract calcium carbonate dextrose agar (YDC) medium and kept at 36¬∞C for 3 days. Colonies of ten typical bacteria isolated from all symptomatic plants were Gram (-), small and uniform in size with rounded edges, yellow, convex with entire borders and mucoid appearance on YDC. Bacteria did not grow on 0.1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride amended casamino acid, peptone, and glucose medium (CPG). Biochemical tests showed that isolates did not reduce nitrate to nitrites, had positive catalase and starch hydrolysis, while the Kovac oxidase test was negative (Schaad and White 1974). Genus identity of the representative isolate Xcf1-APJR, was confirmed by 16S rRNA encoding gene partial sequencing, using universal primers 518F (5'-CCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACG-3') and 800R (5'-TACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3') (Halim et al. 2020). BLASTn alignments against the nucleotide collection were 100% identical to Xanthomonas sequences including Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris strains NZ_AP019684.1, CP025750.1, and MN108237.1. The 1,418 bp sequence was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number MT645246. The identification of species/pathovar was accomplished by serological methods using a polyclonal antiserum specific for X. campestris pv. campestris (Popovic ÃÅ et al. 2013) with the DAS-ELISA commercial kit (catalog number 07122C/096, LOEWE Biochemica GmbH, Germany). The pathogenicity test was carried out on 50 healthy bean plants from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety. Bacterial culture incubated at 28¬∞C for 48 h in YDC medium was used to prepare the bacterial suspension (108 CFU mL-1). The first two lower leaves of 30-day-old plants were inoculated by sprinkling. Ten plants sprayed with sterile distilled water were used as negative control. All plants were kept for 20 days in greenhouse at 18-26¬∞C and relative humidity of 60%. After seven days, chlorotic lesions developed on all inoculated plants that became necrotic from 14 days after inoculation (dai). Necrotic leaf spots merged at 14 dai to form necrotic areas of more than 20 mm in diameter, reaching total necrosis of the leaf tissue at 20 dai and were similar to the symptoms observed in the field. Koch's postulates were confirmed by the reisolation of Xcf1-APJR strain, which presented the same colony morphology, partial sequence, and polyclonal specific detection. This is the first report of this pathogen causing necrotic leaf spot in beans from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety in Puebla-Mexico. The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.

34147079,ORFik: a comprehensive R toolkit for the analysis of translation.,"<h4>Background</h4>With the rapid growth in the use of high-throughput methods for characterizing translation and the continued expansion of multi-omics, there is a need for back-end functions and streamlined tools for processing, analyzing, and characterizing data produced by these assays.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce ORFik, a user-friendly R/Bioconductor API and toolbox for studying translation and its regulation. It extends GenomicRanges from the genome to the transcriptome and implements a framework that integrates data from several sources. ORFik streamlines the steps to process, analyze, and visualize the different steps of translation with a particular focus on initiation and elongation. It accepts high-throughput sequencing data from ribosome profiling to quantify ribosome elongation or RCP-seq/TCP-seq to also quantify ribosome scanning. In addition, ORFik can use CAGE data to accurately determine 5'UTRs and RNA-seq for determining translation relative to RNA abundance. ORFik supports and calculates over 30 different translation-related features and metrics from the literature and can annotate translated regions such as proteins or upstream open reading frames (uORFs). As a use-case, we demonstrate using ORFik to rapidly annotate the dynamics of 5' UTRs across different tissues, detect their uORFs, and characterize their scanning and translation in the downstream protein-coding regions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, ORFik introduces hundreds of tested, documented and optimized methods. ORFik is designed to be easily customizable, enabling users to create complete workflows from raw data to publication-ready figures for several types of sequencing data. Finally, by improving speed and scope of many core Bioconductor functions, ORFik offers enhancement benefiting the entire Bioconductor environment.<h4>Availability</h4>http://bioconductor.org/packages/ORFik .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy solve the inverse problem of reconstructing cell-matrix tractions and inter- and intra-cellular stresses from the measured cell force-induced deformations of an adhesive substrate with known elasticity. Although several laboratories have developed software for Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy computations, there is currently no software package available that allows non-expert users to perform a full evaluation of such experiments. Here we present pyTFM, a tool to perform Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy on cell patches and cell layers grown in a 2-dimensional environment. pyTFM was optimized for ease-of-use; it is open-source and well documented (hosted at https://pytfm.readthedocs.io/) including usage examples and explanations of the theoretical background. pyTFM can be used as a standalone Python package or as an add-on to the image annotation tool ClickPoints. In combination with the ClickPoints environment, pyTFM allows the user to set all necessary analysis parameters, select regions of interest, examine the input data and intermediary results, and calculate a wide range of parameters describing forces, stresses, and their distribution. In this work, we also thoroughly analyze the accuracy and performance of the Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy algorithms of pyTFM using synthetic and experimental data from epithelial cell patches.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,

The patients were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set. The X-tile analysis provides the best age and tumor size cut-off point, and changes continuous variables into categorical variables. The independent prognostic factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and 2 nomograms were established. Receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration curves were used to evaluate the nomograms. Based on the nomograms, 2 web-based nomograms were established.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred and twenty-eight cases were included in the OS nomogram construction, and were randomly divided into a training set (n=160) and a validation set (n=68). Age, T stage, bone metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy, marital status, tumor size, and tumor site were found to be correlated with OS. One hundred and eighty-three cases were enrolled in the CSS nomogram construction, and randomly divided into a training set (n=129) and a validation set (n=54). Age, bone metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy, tumor size, and tumor site were found to be correlated with CSS. Two nomograms were established to predict OS and CSS. In the training set, the areas under the curve of the nomogram for predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS were 0.783, 0.830, and 0.832, respectively, and those for predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year CSS were 0.889, 0.777, and 0.884, respectively. Two web-based nomograms were established to predict OS (https://wenn23.shinyapps.io/lmslmosapp/), and CSS (https://wenn23.shinyapps.io/lmslmcssapp/).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The developed web-based nomogram is a useful tool for accurately analyzing the prognosis of LMS patients with lung metastasis, and could help clinical doctors to make personalized clinical decisions.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

This lacunae introduces critical challenges for interpreting, sensemaking and modeling of addiction epidemiology using social media.<h4>Results</h4>Drug-Use Insights (DUI) is a public and open-source web application to address the aforementioned deficiency. DUI is underlined by a hierarchical taxonomy encompassing 108 different addiction related categories consisting of over 9,000 terms, where each category encompasses a set of semantically related terms. These categories and terms were established by utilizing thematic analysis in conjunction with term embeddings generated from 7,472,545 Reddit posts made by 1,402,017 redditors. Given post(s) from social media forums such as Reddit and Twitter, DUI can be used foremost to identify constituent terms related to drug use. Furthermore, the DUI categories and integrated visualization tools can be leveraged for semantic- and exploratory analysis. To the best of our knowledge, DUI utilizes the largest number of substance use and recovery social media posts used in a study and represents the first significant online taxonomy of drug abuse terminology.<h4>Availability</h4>The DUI web server and source code are available at: http://haddock9.sfsu.edu/insight/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34165340,Application of Text Mining in Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures: A Case Study of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs).,"<h4>Background</h4>Cancer risk assessment of complex exposures, such as exposure to mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is challenging due to the diverse biological activities of these compounds. With the help of text mining (TM), we have developed TM tools-the latest iteration of the Cancer Risk Assessment using Biomedical literature tool (CRAB3) and a Cancer Hallmarks Analytics Tool (CHAT)-that could be useful for automatic literature analyses in cancer risk assessment and research. Although CRAB3 analyses are based on carcinogenic modes of action (MOAs) and cover almost all the key characteristics of carcinogens, CHAT evaluates literature according to the hallmarks of cancer referring to the alterations in cellular behavior that characterize the cancer cell.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective was to evaluate the usefulness of these tools to support cancer risk assessment by performing a case study of 22 European Union and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs and diesel exhaust and a case study of PAH interactions with silica.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed PubMed literature, comprising 57,498 references concerning priority PAHs and complex PAH mixtures, using CRAB3 and CHAT.<h4>Results</h4>CRAB3 analyses correctly identified similarities and differences in genotoxic and nongenotoxic MOAs of the 22 priority PAHs and grouped them according to their known carcinogenic potential. CHAT had the same capacity and complemented the CRAB output when comparing, for example, benzo[<i>a</i>]pyrene and dibenzo[<i>a,l</i>]pyrene. Both CRAB3 and CHAT analyses highlighted potentially interacting mechanisms within and across complex PAH mixtures and mechanisms of possible importance for interactions with silica.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These data suggest that our TM approach can be useful in the hazard identification of PAHs and mixtures including PAHs. The tools can assist in grouping chemicals and identifying similarities and differences in carcinogenic MOAs and their interactions. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6702.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34165986,BlackSheep: A Bioconductor and Bioconda Package for Differential Extreme Value Analysis.,"Unbiased assays such as shotgun proteomics and RNA-seq provide high-resolution molecular characterization of tumors. These assays measure molecules with highly varied distributions, making interpretation and hypothesis testing challenging. Samples with the most extreme measurements for a molecule can reveal the most interesting biological insights yet are often excluded from analysis. Furthermore, rare disease subtypes are, by definition, underrepresented in cancer cohorts. To provide a strategy for identifying molecules aberrantly enriched in small sample cohorts, we present BlackSheep, a package for nonparametric description and differential analysis of genome-wide data, available from Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/blacksheepr.html) and Bioconda (https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/blksheep/README.html). BlackSheep is a complementary tool to other differential expression analysis methods, which is particularly useful when analyzing small subgroups in a larger cohort.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
34174821,"Construction of a high-density linkage map and graphical representation of the arrangement of transcriptome-based unigene markers on the chromosomes of onion, Allium cepa L.","<h4>Background</h4>Genomic information for Allium cepa L. is limited as it is heterozygous and its genome is very large. To elucidate potential SNP markers obtained by NGS, we used a complete set of A. fistulosum L.-A. cepa monosomic addition lines (MALs) and doubled haploids (DHs). These were the parental lines of an A. cepa mapping population for transcriptome-based SNP genotyping.<h4>Results</h4>We mapped the transcriptome sequence reads from a series of A. fistulosum-A. cepa MALs onto the unigene sequence of the doubled haploid shallot A. cepa Aggregatum group (DHA) and compared the MAL genotype call for parental bunching onion and shallot transcriptome mapping data. We identified SNP sites with at least four reads on 25,462 unigenes. They were anchored on eight A. cepa chromosomes. A single SNP site was identified on 3,278 unigenes and multiple SNPs were identified on 22,184 unigenes. The chromosome marker information was made public via the web database Allium TDB ( http://alliumtdb.kazusa.or.jp/ ). To apply transcriptome based genotyping approach for genetic mapping, we gathered RNA sequence data from 96 lines of a DHA √ó doubled haploid bulb onion A. cepa common onion group (DHC) mapping population. After selecting co-dominant SNP sites, 16,872 SNPs were identified in 5,339 unigenes. Of these, at least two SNPs with identical genotypes were found in 1,435 unigenes. We developed a linkage map using genotype information from these unigenes. All unigene markers mapped onto the eight chromosomes and graphical genotyping was conducted based on the unigene order information. Another 2,963 unigenes were allocated onto the eight chromosomes. To confirm the accuracy of this transcriptome-based genetic linkage map, conventional PCR-based markers were used for linkage analysis. All SNP - and PCR-based markers were mapped onto the expected linkage groups and no inconsistency was found among these chromosomal locations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Effective transcriptome analysis with unique Allium resources successfully associated numerous chromosome markers with unigene information and a high-density A. cepa linkage map. The information on these unigene markers is valuable in genome sequencing and useful trait detection in Allium.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,references other db,not descriptive of resource
34175254,Robot-assisted Versus Open Radical Cystectomy in Bladder Cancer: An Economic Evaluation Alongside a Multicentre Comparative Effectiveness Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Open radical cystectomy (ORC) is regarded as the standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, but robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is increasingly used in practice. A recent study showed that RARC resulted in slightly fewer minor but slightly more major complications, although the difference was not statistically significant. Some differences were found in secondary outcomes favouring either RARC or ORC. RARC use is expected to increase in coming years, which fuels the debate about whether RARC provides value for money.<h4>Objective</h4>To assess the cost-effectiveness of RARC compared to ORC in bladder cancer.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This economic evaluation was performed alongside a prospective multicentre comparative effectiveness study. We included 348 bladder cancer patients (ORC, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ168; RARC, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ180) from 19 Dutch hospitals.<h4>Outcome measurements and statistical analysis</h4>Over 1 yr, we assessed the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from both healthcare and societal perspectives. We used single imputation nested in the bootstrap percentile method to assess missing data and uncertainty, and inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for potential bias. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the impact of various parameters on the cost difference.<h4>Results and limitations</h4>The mean healthcare cost per patient was ‚Ç¨17‚Äâ141 (95% confidence interval [CI] ‚Ç¨15‚Äâ791-‚Ç¨18‚Äâ720) for ORC and ‚Ç¨21‚Äâ266 (95% CI ‚Ç¨19‚Äâ163-‚Ç¨23 650) for RARC. The mean societal cost per patient was ‚Ç¨18‚Äâ926 (95% CI ‚Ç¨17‚Äâ431-‚Ç¨22‚Äâ642) for ORC and ‚Ç¨24‚Äâ896 (95% CI ‚Ç¨21‚Äâ925-‚Ç¨31‚Äâ888) for RARC. On average, RARC patients gained 0.79 QALYs (95% CI 0.74-0.85) compared to 0.81 QALYs (95% CI 0.77-0.85) for ORC patients, resulting in a mean QALY difference of -0.02 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.02). Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of ‚Ç¨80‚Äâ000, RARC was cost-effective in 0.6% and 0.2% of the replications for the healthcare and societal perspectives, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RARC shows no difference in terms of QALYs, but is more expensive than ORC. Hence, RARC does not seem to provide value for money in comparison to ORC.<h4>Patient summary</h4>This study assessed the relation between costs and effects of robot-assisted surgery compared to open surgery for removal of the bladder in 348 Dutch patients with bladder cancer. We found that after 1 year, the two approaches were similarly effective according to a measure called quality-adjusted life years, but robot-assisted surgery was much more expensive.

34179956,The DNA methylation haplotype (mHap) format and mHapTools.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) is currently the gold standard for measuring genome-wide DNA methylation profiles at single-nucleotide resolution. Most analyses focus on mean CpG methylation and ignore methylation states on the same DNA fragments [DNA methylation haplotypes (mHaps)]. Here, we propose mHap, a simple DNA mHap format for storing DNA BS-seq data. This format reduces the size of a BAM file by 40- to 140-fold while retaining complete read-level CpG methylation information. It is also compatible with the Tabix tool for fast and random access. We implemented a command-line tool, mHapTools, for converting BAM/SAM files from existing platforms to mHap files as well as post-processing DNA methylation data in mHap format. With this tool, we processed all publicly available human reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data and provided these data as a comprehensive mHap database.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://jiantaoshi.github.io/mHap/index.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",1,0,1,2,0.5,database of reformatted previous data,
34180600,Primary antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori isolates is twofold more frequent in HIV-positive than HIV-negative individuals: A descriptive observational study.,"The antimicrobial susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from HIV-positive individuals is not well characterized. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and long-term trends associated with primary H. pylori antibiotic resistance, evaluate correlations with antibiotic consumption, and compare predictors for H. pylori antibiotic resistance between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. In this longitudinal registry study, we evaluated consecutive adults with and without HIV infection, na√Øve to H. pylori treatment, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and had a positive H. pylori culture, with susceptibility testing available, between 2004 and 2015. Outpatient antibiotic consumption data were based on nationwide aggregated numbers. H. pylori was isolated from gastric biopsies of 3008/8321 patients, 181/477 (37.9%) were HIV-positive and 2827/7844 (36.0%) HIV-negative. Overall cohort mean prevalence of H. pylori primary antibiotic resistance was 11.1% for clarithromycin, 17.8% levofloxacin, and 39.4% metronidazole. The prevalence of H. pylori primary resistance was significantly higher for these three drugs in HIV-positive individuals across the study period. Linear regression showed that the prevalence of clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance correlated with the country aggregate daily dose consumption of macrolides and quinolones, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that HIV infection is a strong independent risk factor for multiple H. pylori antibiotic resistance. In summary, HIV infection is a risk factor for carrying multi-resistant H. pylori strains and this is correlated with antibiotic consumption. Empirical therapies should be avoided in HIV-positive individuals. These data highlight the need to implement ongoing monitoring of H. pylori antimicrobial susceptibility among HIV-positive individuals.

A random sampling strategy based on an ecosystem framework comprising 11 ecozones was adopted to collect representative nutritional and environmental health results for all First Nations adults living on-reserve south of the 60<sup>th</sup> parallel. Data collection occurred during the fall months from 2008 to 2016. Respective First Nations were involved in the planning and implementation of data collection for the five principal components: household interviews, tap water sampling for metals, surface water sampling for pharmaceuticals, hair sampling for mercury, and traditional food sampling for contaminants.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 6487 adults from 92 First Nations participated in the Study (participation rate 78%). A higher percentage of females (66%) participated than males (34%). The average age of males and females was similar (44 and 45 years, respectively). This study offers a novel body of coherent and regionally representative evidence on the human dimension of the ongoing environmental degradation affecting First Nations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>FNFNES serves as a good example of participatory research. We encourage public health professionals to develop policy and programs building on the participatory dimension of the research as well as on its results. The information collected by the FNFNES is also important for community empowerment, environmental stewardship and the general promotion of good health by and for First Nations peoples in Canada.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34181547,An Approach of Epistasis Detection Using Integer Linear Programming Optimizing Bayesian Network.,"Proposing a more effective and accurate epistatic loci detection method in large-scale genomic data has important research significance. Bayesian network (BN) has been widely used in constructing the network of SNPs and phenotype traits and thus to mine epistatic loci. In this work, we transform the problem of learning Bayesian network into the optimization of integer linear programming (ILP). We use the algorithms of branch-and-bound and cutting planes to get the global optimal Bayesian network (ILPBN), and thus to get epistatic loci influencing specific phenotype traits. In order to handle large-scale of SNP loci and further to improve efficiency, we use the method of optimizing Markov blanket to reduce the number of candidate parent nodes for each node. In addition, we use -BIC that is suitable for processing the epistatis mining to calculate the BN score. We use four properties of BN decomposable scoring functions to further reduce the number of candidate parent sets for each node. Finally, we compare ILPBN with several popular epistasis mining algorithms by using simulated and real Age-related macular disease (AMD) dataset. Experiment results show that ILPBN has better epistasis detection accuracy, F1-score and false positive rate in premise of ensuring the efficiency.

However, there is a paucity of web servers to conduct fast, focussed, and customized investigations for identifying new uses of old drugs. We present the NOD web server, which has the mentioned characteristics. NOD uses a sensitive sequence-guided approach to identify close and distant homologs of a protein of interest. NOD then exploits this evolutionary information to suggest potential compounds from the DrugBank database that can be repurposed against the input protein. NOD also allows expansion of the chemical space of the potential candidates through similarity searches. We have validated the performance of NOD against available experimental and/or clinical reports. In 65.6% of the investigated cases in a control study, NOD is able to identify drugs more effectively than the searches made in DrugBank.

Training and testing were conducted with a 75:25 breakdown. Area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were used to compare different CNN models' performances in classifying TM images.<h4>Results</h4>Our database included 400 images, organized into normal (n‚Ää=‚Ää196) and abnormal classes (n‚Ää=‚Ää204), including acute otitis media (n‚Ää=‚Ää116), otitis externa (n‚Ää=‚Ää44), chronic suppurative otitis media (n‚Ää=‚Ää23), and cerumen impaction (n‚Ää=‚Ää21). For binary classification between normal versus abnormal TM, the best performing model had average AUC-ROC of 0.902 (MobileNetV2), followed by 0.745 (Inception-Resnet-V2), 0.731 (ResNet-50), and 0.636 (Inception-V3). Accuracy ranged between 0.73-0.77, sensitivity 0.72-0.88, specificity 0.58-0.84, PPV 0.68-0.81, and NPV 0.73-0.83. Macro-AUC-ROC for MobileNetV2 based multiclass-classifier was 0.91, with accuracy of 66%. Binary and multiclass-classifier models based on MobileNetV2 were loaded onto a publicly accessible and user-friendly website (https://headneckml.com/tympanic). This allows the readership to upload TM images for real-time predictions using the developed algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Novel CNN algorithms were developed with high AUC-ROCs for differentiating between various TM pathologies.

Median follow-up was 31 months. Superior rectal artery ligation was associated with a similar anastomotic leak rate compared to inferior mesenteric artery ligation (9vs8%, p=1.0). Median number of lymph nodes removed was identical (15vs15, p=0.38). On multivariable analysis accounting for relevant clinicopathologic factors, superior rectal artery ligation was not associated with increased anastomotic leak rate, worse lymph node harvest, or worse locoregional recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival, or overall survival (all p>0.1).<h4>Limitations</h4>This was a retrospective design.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared to inferior mesenteric artery ligation, superior rectal artery ligation is not associated with either worse technical or oncologic outcomes. Given the potential risks of inadequate blood flow to the proximal limb of the anastomosis and autonomic nerve injury, we advocate for increased utilization of superior rectal artery ligation.

Health literacy plays a crucial role in promoting healthy behaviour and thereby maintaining good health. This study explores the role of health literacy in the GeMuKi (acronym for 'Gemeinsam Gesund: Vorsorge plus f√ºr Mutter und Kind'-Strengthening health promotion: enhanced check-up visits for mother and child) Project. It will assess the ability of the GeMuKi lifestyle intervention to positively affect health literacy levels through active participation in preventive counselling. The study also explores associations between health literacy, health outcomes, health service use and effectiveness of the intervention.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>The GeMuKi trial has a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design and is carried out in routine prenatal health service settings in Germany. Women (n=1860) are recruited by their gynaecologist during routine check-up visits before 12 weeks of gestation. Trained healthcare providers carry out counselling using motivational interviewing techniques to positively affect health literacy and lifestyle-related risk factors. Healthcare providers (gynaecologists and midwives) and women jointly agree on Specific, Measurable, Achievable Reasonable, Time-Bound goals. Women will be invited to fill in questionnaires at two time points (at recruitment and 37th-40th week of gestation) using an app. Health literacy is measured using the German version of the Health Literacy Survey-16 and the Brief Health Literacy Screener. Lifestyle is measured with questions on physical activity, nutrition, alcohol and drug use. Health outcomes of both mother and child, including gestational weight gain (GWG) will be documented at each routine visit. Health service use will be assessed using social health insurance claims data. Data analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 26.0. These include descriptive statistics, tests and regression models. A mediation model will be conducted to answer the question whether health behaviour mediates the association between health literacy and GWG.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study was approved by the University Hospital of Cologne Research Ethics Committee (ID: 18-163) and the State Chamber of Physicians in Baden-Wuerttemberg (ID: B-F-2018-100).

34213323,pdCSM-cancer: Using Graph-Based Signatures to Identify Small Molecules with Anticancer Properties.,"The development of new, effective, and safe drugs to treat cancer remains a challenging and time-consuming task due to limited hit rates, restraining subsequent development efforts. Despite the impressive progress of quantitative structure-activity relationship and machine learning-based models that have been developed to predict molecule pharmacodynamics and bioactivity, they have had mixed success at identifying compounds with anticancer properties against multiple cell lines. Here, we have developed a novel predictive tool, pdCSM-cancer, which uses a graph-based signature representation of the chemical structure of a small molecule in order to accurately predict molecules likely to be active against one or multiple cancer cell lines. pdCSM-cancer represents the most comprehensive anticancer bioactivity prediction platform developed till date, comprising trained and validated models on experimental data of the growth inhibition concentration (GI50%) effects, including over 18,000 compounds, on 9 tumor types and 74 distinct cancer cell lines. Across 10-fold cross-validation, it achieved Pearson's correlation coefficients of up to 0.74 and comparable performance of up to 0.67 across independent, non-redundant blind tests. Leveraging the insights from these cell line-specific models, we developed a generic predictive model to identify molecules active in at least 60 cell lines. Our final model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of up to 0.94 on 10-fold cross-validation and up to 0.94 on independent non-redundant blind tests, outperforming alternative approaches. We believe that our predictive tool will provide a valuable resource to optimizing and enriching screening libraries for the identification of effective and safe anticancer molecules. To provide a simple and integrated platform to rapidly screen for potential biologically active molecules with favorable anticancer properties, we made pdCSM-cancer freely available online at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/pdcsm_cancer.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,data to train and test and the models

Moreover, to visualize the prediction results, we established a web-based calculator ( https://ncutool.shinyapps.io/CKDprogression/ ).<h4>Conclusion</h4>An easy-to-operate model based on five relevant factors was developed and validated as a conventional tool to assist doctors with clinical decision-making and personalized treatment.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
34224351,Deep Learning for Ultrasound Image Formation: CUBDL Evaluation Framework &amp; Open Datasets.,"Deep learning for ultrasound image formation is rapidly garnering research support and attention, quickly rising as the latest frontier in ultrasound image formation, with much promise to balance both image quality and display speed. Despite this promise, one challenge with identifying optimal solutions is the absence of unified evaluation methods and datasets that are not specific to a single research group. This paper introduces the largest known international database of ultrasound channel data and describes associated evaluation methods that were initially developed for the Challenge on Ultrasound Beamforming with Deep Learning (CUBDL), which was offered as a component of the 2020 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium. We summarize the challenge results and present qualitative and quantitative assessments using both the initially closed CUBDL evaluation test dataset (which was crowd-sourced from multiple groups around the world) and additional in vivo breast ultrasound data contributed after the challenge was completed. As an example quantitative assessment, single plane wave images from the CUBDL Task 1 dataset produced a mean generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) of 0.67 and a mean lateral resolution of 0.42 mm when formed with delay-and-sum beamforming, compared to a mean gCNR as high as 0.81 and a mean lateral resolution as low as 0.32 mm when formed with networks submitted by the challenge winners. We also describe contributed CUBDL data that may be used for training of future networks. The compiled database includes a total of 576 image acquisition sequences. We additionally introduce a neural network-based global sound speed estimator implementation that was necessary to fairly evaluate results obtained with this international database. The integration of CUBDL evaluation methods, evaluation code, network weights from the challenge winners, and all datasets described herein are publicly available (visit https://cubdl.jhu.edu for details).","hji,kes",1,0,1,2,0.5,Available model training data,training and test data

34236262,"The prognosis of glioblastoma: a large, multifactorial study.","<h4>Objective</h4>Glioblastoma is the most common and fatal primary brain tumor in adults. Even with maximal resection and a series of postoperative adjuvant treatments, the median overall survival (OS) of glioblastoma patients remains approximately 15 months. The Huashan Hospital glioma bank contains more than 2000 glioma tissue samples with long-term follow-up data; almost half of these samples are from glioblastoma patients. Several large glioma databases with long-term follow-up data have reported outcomes of glioblastoma patients from countries other than China. We investigated the prognosis of glioblastoma patients in China and compared the survival outcomes among patients from different databases.<h4>Methods</h4>The data for 967 glioblastoma patients who underwent surgery at Huashan Hospital and had long-term follow-up records were obtained from our glioma registry (diagnosed from 29 March 2010, through 7 June 2017). Patients were eligible for inclusion if they underwent surgical resection for newly diagnosed glioblastomas and had available data of survival and personal information. Data of 778 glioblastoma patients were collected from three separate online databases (448 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://cancergenome.nih.gov), 191 from REpository for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa (REMBRANDT) database (GSE108476) and 132 from data set GSE16011(Hereafter called as the French database). We compared the prognosis of glioblastoma patients from records among the different databases and the changes in survival outcomes of glioblastoma patients from Huashan Hospital over an 8-year period.<h4>Results</h4>The median OS of glioblastoma patients was 16.3 (95% CI: 15.4-17.2) months for Huashan Hospital, 13.8 (95% CI: 12.9-14.9) months for TCGA, 19.3 (95% CI: 17.0-20.0) months for the REMBRANDT database, and 9.1 months for the French database. The median OS of glioblastoma patients from Huashan Hospital improved from 15.6 (2010-2013, 95% CI: 14.4-16.6) months to 18.2 (2014-2017, 95% CI: 15.8-20.6) months over the study period (2010-2017). In addition, the prognosis of glioblastoma patients with total resection was significantly better than that of glioblastoma patients with sub-total resection or biopsy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study confirms that treatment centered around maximal surgical resection brought survival benefits to glioblastoma patients after adjusting to validated prognostic factors. In addition, an improvement in prognosis was observed among glioblastoma patients from Huashan Hospital over the course of our study. We attributed it to the adoption of a new standard of neurosurgical treatment on the basis of neurosurgical multimodal technologies. Even though the prognosis of glioblastoma patients remains poor, gradual progress is being made.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not descriptive of resource
29724163,EuGI: a novel resource for studying genomic islands to facilitate horizontal gene transfer detection in eukaryotes.,"BACKGROUND:Genomic islands (GIs) are inserts of foreign DNA that have potentially arisen through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). There are evidences that GIs can contribute significantly to the evolution of prokaryotes. The acquisition of GIs through HGT in eukaryotes has, however, been largely unexplored. In this study, the previously developed GI prediction tool, SeqWord Gene Island Sniffer (SWGIS), is modified to predict GIs in eukaryotic chromosomes. Artificial simulations are used to estimate ratios of predicting false positive and false negative GIs by inserting GIs into different test chromosomes and performing the SWGIS v2.0 algorithm. Using SWGIS v2.0, GIs are then identified in 36 fungal, 22 protozoan and 8 invertebrate genomes. RESULTS:SWGIS v2.0 predicts GIs in large eukaryotic chromosomes based on the atypical nucleotide composition of these regions. Averages for predicting false negative and false positive GIs were 20.1% and 11.01% respectively. A total of 10,550 GIs were identified in 66 eukaryotic species with 5299 of these GIs coding for at least one functional protein. The EuGI web-resource, freely accessible at http://eugi.bi.up.ac.za , was developed that allows browsing the database created from identified GIs and genes within GIs through an interactive and visual interface. CONCLUSIONS:SWGIS v2.0 along with the EuGI database, which houses GIs identified in 66 different eukaryotic species, and the EuGI web-resource, provide the first comprehensive resource for studying HGT in eukaryotes.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,software,

To facilitate the research in this field we have updated our mining web server. BAGEL4 is faster than its predecessor and is now fully independent from ORF-calling. Gene clusters of interest are discovered using the core-peptide database and/or through HMM motifs that are present in associated context genes. The databases used for mining have been updated and extended with literature references and links to UniProt and NCBI. Additionally, we have included automated promoter and terminator prediction and the option to upload RNA expression data, which can be displayed along with the identified clusters. Further improvements include the annotation of the context genes, which is now based on a fast blast against the prokaryote part of the UniRef90 database, and the improved web-BLAST feature that dynamically loads structural data such as internal cross-linking from UniProt.

We describe here the establishment of a cyanobacterial culture collection (CC) and present the first version of the strain catalog and its online database (http://lege.ciimar.up.pt/). The LEGE CC holds 386 strains, mainly collected in coastal (48%), estuarine (11%), and fresh (34%) water bodies, for the most part from Portugal (84%). By following the most recent taxonomic classification, LEGE CC strains were classified into at least 46 genera from six orders (41% belong to the Synechococcales), several of them are unique among the phylogenetic diversity of the cyanobacteria. For all strains, primary data were obtained and secondary data were surveyed and reviewed, which can be reached through the strain sheets either in the catalog or in the online database. An overview on the notable biodiversity of LEGE CC strains is showcased, including a searchable phylogenetic tree and images for all strains. With this work, 80% of the LEGE CC strains have now their 16S rRNA gene sequences deposited in GenBank. Also, based in primary data, it is demonstrated that several LEGE CC strains are a promising source of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Through a review of previously published data, it is exposed that LEGE CC strains have the potential or actual capacity to produce a variety of biotechnologically interesting compounds, including common cyanotoxins or unprecedented bioactive molecules. Phylogenetic diversity of LEGE CC strains does not entirely reflect chemodiversity. Further bioprospecting should, therefore, account for strain specificity of the valuable cyanobacterial holdings of LEGE CC.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
29997612,CDG: An Online Server for Detecting Biologically Closest Disease-Causing Genes and its Application to Primary Immunodeficiency.,"High-throughput genomic technologies yield about 20,000 variants in the protein-coding exome of each individual. A commonly used approach to select candidate disease-causing variants is to test whether the associated gene has been previously reported to be disease-causing. In the absence of known disease-causing genes, it can be challenging to associate candidate genes with specific genetic diseases. To facilitate the discovery of novel gene-disease associations, we determined the putative biologically closest known genes and their associated diseases for 13,005 human genes not currently reported to be disease-associated. We used these data to construct the closest disease-causing genes (CDG) server, which can be used to infer the closest genes with an associated disease for a user-defined list of genes or diseases. We demonstrate the utility of the CDG server in five immunodeficiency patient exomes across different diseases and modes of inheritance, where CDG dramatically reduced the number of candidate genes to be evaluated. This resource will be a considerable asset for ascertaining the potential relevance of genetic variants found in patient exomes to specific diseases of interest.

30219844,TCellXTalk facilitates the detection of co-modified peptides for the study of protein post-translational modification cross-talk in T cells.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Protein function is regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that may act individually or interact with others in a phenomenon termed PTM cross-talk. Multiple databases have been dedicated to PTMs, including recent initiatives oriented towards the in silico prediction of PTM interactions. The study of PTM cross-talk ultimately requires experimental evidence about whether certain PTMs coexist in a single protein molecule. However, available resources do not assist researchers in the experimental detection of co-modified peptides.<h4>Results</h4>Herein, we present TCellXTalk, a comprehensive database of phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation sites in human T cells that supports the experimental detection of co-modified peptides using targeted or directed mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of TCellXTalk and the strategy presented here in a proof of concept experiment that enabled the identification and quantification of 15 co-modified (phosphorylated and ubiquitinated) peptides from CD3 proteins of the T-cell receptor complex. To our knowledge, these are the first co-modified peptide sequences described in this widely studied cell type. Furthermore, quantitative data showed distinct dynamics for co-modified peptides upon T cell activation, demonstrating differential regulation of co-occurring PTMs in this biological context. Overall, TCellXTalk facilitates the experimental detection of co-modified peptides in human T cells and puts forward a novel and generic strategy for the study of PTM cross-talk.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>TCellXTalk is available at https://www.tcellxtalk.org.

To identify patterns of drug-induced gene modulation that occur in different cancer cell types, we measured gene-expression changes across the NCI-60 cell line panel after exposure to 15 anticancer agents. The results were integrated into a combined database and set of interactive analysis tools, designated the NCI Transcriptional Pharmacodynamics Workbench (NCI TPW), that allows exploration of gene-expression modulation by molecular pathway, drug target, and association with drug sensitivity. We identified common transcriptional responses across agents and cell types and uncovered gene-expression changes associated with drug sensitivity. We also demonstrated the value of this tool for investigating clinically relevant molecular hypotheses and identifying candidate biomarkers of drug activity.

30715167,The global dissemination of bacterial infections necessitates the study of reverse genomic epidemiology.,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized the genotyping of bacterial pathogens and is expected to become the new gold standard for tracing the transmissions of bacterial infectious diseases for public health purposes. Traditional genomic epidemiology often uses WGS as a verification tool, namely, when a common source or epidemiological link is suspected, the collected isolates are sequenced for the determination of clonal relationships. However, increasingly frequent international travel and food transportation, and the associated potential for the cross-border transmission of bacterial pathogens, often lead to an absence of information on bacterial transmission routes. Here we introduce the concept of 'reverse genomic epidemiology', i.e. when isolates are inspected by genome comparisons to be sufficiently similar to one another, they are assumed to be a consequence of infection from a common source. Through BacWGSTdb (http://bacdb.org/BacWGSTdb/), a database we have developed for bacterial genome typing and source tracking, we have found that almost the entire analyzed 20 bacterial species exhibit the phenomenon of cross-border clonal dissemination. Five networks were further identified in which isolates sharing nearly identical genomes were collected from at least five different countries. Three of these have been documented as real infectious disease outbreaks, therefore demonstrating the feasibility and authority of reverse genomic epidemiology. Our survey and proposed strategy would be of potential value in establishing a global surveillance system for tracing bacterial transmissions and outbreaks; the related database and techniques require urgent standardization.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,an update on the usefulness of their data resource,

However, growing evidences support the view of this reversible reaction also as a regulatory post-translational modification. Thus, the oxidation of methionine residues has been reported to have multiple and varied implications for protein function. However, despite the importance of this modification and the abundance of reports, all these data are scattered in the literature. No database/resource on methionine sulfoxidation exists currently. Since this information is useful to gain further insights into the redox regulation of cellular proteins, we have created a primary database of experimentally confirmed sulfoxidation sites.<h4>Results</h4>MetOSite currently contains 7242 methionine sulfoxide sites found in 3562 different proteins from 23 species, with Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana and Bacillus cereus as the main contributors. Each collected site has been classified according to the effect of its sulfoxidation on the biological properties of the modified protein. Thus, MetOSite documents cases where the sulfoxidation of methionine leads to (i) gain of activity, (ii) loss of activity, (iii) increased protein-protein interaction susceptibility, (iv) decreased protein-protein interaction susceptibility, (v) changes in protein stability and (vi) changes in subcellular location.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MetOSite is available at https://metosite.uma.es.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
31307376,PhenPath: a tool for characterizing biological functions underlying different phenotypes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Many diseases are associated with complex patterns of symptoms and phenotypic manifestations. Parsimonious explanations aim at reconciling the multiplicity of phenotypic traits with the perturbation of one or few biological functions. For this, it is necessary to characterize human phenotypes at the molecular and functional levels, by exploiting gene annotations and known relations among genes, diseases and phenotypes. This characterization makes it possible to implement tools for retrieving functions shared among phenotypes, co-occurring in the same patient and facilitating the formulation of hypotheses about the molecular causes of the disease.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce PhenPath, a new resource consisting of two parts: PhenPathDB and PhenPathTOOL. The former is a database collecting the human genes associated with the phenotypes described in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and OMIM Clinical Synopses. Phenotypes are then associated with biological functions and pathways by means of NET-GE, a network-based method for functional enrichment of sets of genes. The present version considers only phenotypes related to diseases. PhenPathDB collects information for 18 OMIM Clinical synopses and 7137 HPO phenotypes, related to 4292 diseases and 3446 genes. Enrichment of Gene Ontology annotations endows some 87.7, 86.9 and 73.6% of HPO phenotypes with Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component terms, respectively. Furthermore, 58.8 and 77.8% of HPO phenotypes are also enriched for KEGG and Reactome pathways, respectively. Based on PhenPathDB, PhenPathTOOL analyzes user-defined sets of phenotypes retrieving diseases, genes and functional terms which they share. This information can provide clues for interpreting the co-occurrence of phenotypes in a patient.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The resource allows finding molecular features useful to investigate diseases characterized by multiple phenotypes, and by this, it can help researchers and physicians in identifying molecular mechanisms and biological functions underlying the concomitant manifestation of phenotypes.

Recent high-throughput gene expression profiling of blood samples from cancer patients has provided a valuable resource for developing new biomarkers for the early detection of cancer. However, a well-organized online repository for these blood-based high-throughput gene expression data is still not available. Here, we present BBCancer (http://bbcancer.renlab.org/), a web-accessible and comprehensive open resource for providing the expression landscape of six types of RNAs, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), tRNA-derived fragments (tRFRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in blood samples, including plasma, CTCs and EVs, from cancer patients with various cancer types. Currently, BBCancer contains expression data of the six RNA types from 5040 normal and tumor blood samples across 15 cancer types. We believe this database will serve as a powerful platform for developing blood biomarkers.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Several advantages, such as easy genetic transformation and short generation duration, have led to the emergence of J. curcas as a model for woody energy plants. With the development of high-throughput sequencing, the genome of Jatropha curcas has been sequenced by different groups and a mass of transcriptome data was released. How to integrate and analyze these omics data is crucial for functional genomics research on J. curcas.<h4>Results</h4>By establishing pipelines for processing novel gene identification, gene function annotation, and gene network construction, we systematically integrated and analyzed a series of J. curcas transcriptome data. Based on these data, we constructed a J. curcas database (JCDB), which not only includes general gene information, gene functional annotation, gene interaction networks, and gene expression matrices but also provides tools for browsing, searching, and downloading data, as well as online BLAST, the JBrowse genome browser, ID conversion, heatmaps, and gene network analysis tools.<h4>Conclusions</h4>JCDB is the most comprehensive and well annotated knowledge base for J. curcas.

31942979,Phenotype-genotype network construction and characterization: a case study of cardiovascular diseases and associated non-coding RNAs.,"The phenotype-genotype relationship is a key for personalized and precision medicine for complex diseases. To unravel the complexity of the clinical phenotype-genotype network, we used cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and associated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (i.e. miRNAs, long ncRNAs, etc.) as the case for the study of CVDs at a systems or network level. We first integrated a database of CVDs and ncRNAs (CVDncR, http://sysbio.org.cn/cvdncr/) to construct CVD-ncRNA networks and annotate their clinical associations. To characterize the networks, we then separated the miRNAs into two groups, i.e. universal miRNAs associated with at least two types of CVDs and specific miRNAs related only to one type of CVD. Our analyses indicated two interesting patterns in these CVD-ncRNA networks. First, scale-free features were present within both CVD-miRNA and CVD-lncRNA networks; second, universal miRNAs were more likely to be CVDs biomarkers. These results were confirmed by computational functional analyses. The findings offer theoretical guidance for decoding CVD-ncRNA associations and will facilitate the screening of CVD ncRNA biomarkers.

This species enjoys the availability of a wide range of research tools, well-annotated reference databases and highly similar gene circuitry to other insects. To facilitate molecular mechanism studies in Drosophila, we present the Predicted Drosophila Interactome Resource (PDIR), a database of high-quality predicted functional gene interactions. These interactions were inferred from evidence in 10 public databases providing information for functional gene interactions from diverse perspectives. The current version of PDIR includes 102‚Äâ835 putative functional associations with balanced sensitivity and specificity, which are expected to cover 22.56% of all Drosophila protein interactions. This set of functional interactions is a good reference for hypothesis formulation in molecular mechanism studies. At the same time, these interactions also serve as a high-quality reference interactome for gene set linkage analysis (GSLA), which is a web tool for the interpretation of the potential functional impacts of a set of changed genes observed in transcriptomics analyses. In a case study, we show that the PDIR/GSLA system was able to produce a more comprehensive and concise interpretation of the collective functional impact of multiple simultaneously changed genes compared with the widely used gene set annotation tools, including PANTHER and David.

Accumulating evidence reveals that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are closely associated with a wide variety of EDs. However, abundant associations between ncRNAs and EDs are scattered across the published literature, obstructing a global view of ncRNA-ED associations. A public resource of high-quality manually curated ncRNAomics knowledge associated with EDs remains unavailable. To address this gap, we thus developed Nc2Eye (http://nc2eye.bio-data.cn/), which is the first knowledgebase dedicated to providing a comprehensive ncRNAomics resource for bridging basic and clinical research in EDs. Through a comprehensive review of more than 2400 published papers, Nc2Eye catalogs 7088 manually curated ncRNA-ED associations involving 4363 ncRNAs across eight species. We also provide detailed descriptions and annotation information for each ncRNA-disease association such as ncRNA categories, experimental methods, expression pattern and related clinical drugs. To further expand the pathogenic ncRNAs, we also collected more than 90 high-throughput EDs-related transcriptome datasets. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface was constructed for convenient and flexible data browsing, querying, and retrieving. We believe that Nc2Eye is a timely and valuable knowledgebase for significantly improving and useful for discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Gene and protein regulatory networks are subsequently being derived based on these proteogenomic profiles, which serve as tools to gain systems-level understanding of the molecular regulatory factories underlying these diseases. On the other hand, it remains a challenge to effectively visualize and navigate the resulting network models, which capture higher order structures in the proteogenomic profiles.

The m6A modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by a series of writers, erasers and readers (WERs). Different WERs might have different functions, and even the same WER might function differently in different conditions, which are mostly due to different downstream genes being targeted by the WERs. Therefore, identification of the targets of WERs is particularly important for elucidating this dynamic modification. However, there is still no public repository to host the known targets of WERs. Therefore, we developed the m6A WER target gene database (m6A2Target) to provide a comprehensive resource of the targets of m6A WERs.

Yet, a systematic study on the switch in their interaction pattern between activation and suppression and between normal and cancer conditions based on multi-omics evidences is not available. We built miRactDB, a database for miRNA-gene interaction, at https://ccsm.uth.edu/miRactDB, to provide a versatile resource and platform for annotation and interpretation of miRNA-gene relations. We conducted a comprehensive investigation on miRNA-gene interactions and their biological implications across tissue types in both tumour and normal conditions, based on TCGA, CCLE and GTEx databases. We particularly explored the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms potentially contributing to the positive correlation, including identification of miRNA binding sites in the gene coding sequence (CDS) and promoter regions of partner genes. Integrative analysis based on this resource revealed that top-ranked genes derived from TCGA tumour and adjacent normal samples share an overwhelming part of biological processes, which are quite different than those from CCLE and GTEx. The most active miRNAs predicted to target CDS and promoter regions are largely overlapped. These findings corroborate that adjacent normal tissues might have undergone significant molecular transformations towards oncogenesis before phenotypic and histological change; and there probably exists a small yet critical set of miRNAs that profoundly influence various cancer hallmark processes. miRactDB provides a unique resource for the cancer and genomics communities to screen, prioritize and rationalize their candidates of miRNA-gene interactions, in both normal and cancer scenarios.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

The disease owes its genesis to Kinnier Wilson who described the disease, and is caused by accumulation of Copper (Cu) in various organs including the liver, central nervous system, cornea, kidney, joints and cardiac muscle which contribute to the characteristic clinical features of WD. A number of studies have reported genetic variants in the ATP7B gene from diverse ethnic and geographical origins. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing approaches has also enabled the discovery of a large number of novel variants in the gene associated with the disease. Previous attempts have been made to compile the knowledgebase and spectrum of genetic variants from across the multitude of publications, but have been limited by the utility due to the significant differences in approaches used to qualify pathogenicity of variants in each of the publications. The recent formulation of guidelines and algorithms for assessment of the pathogenicity of variants jointly put forward by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association of Molecular Pathologists (ACMG &AMP) has provided a framework for evidence based and systematic assessment of pathogenicity of variants. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive resource of genetic variants in ATP7B gene manually curated from literature and data resources and systematically annotated using the ACMG & AMP guidelines for assessing pathogenicity. The resource therefore serves as a central point for clinicians and geneticists working on WD and to the best of our knowledge is the most comprehensive and only clinically annotated resource for WD. The resource is available at URL http://clingen.igib.res.in/WilsonGen/. We compiled a total of 3662 genetic variants from publications and databases associated with WD. Of these variants compiled, a total of 1458 were found to be unique entries. This is the largest WD database comprising 656 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants reported classified according to ACMG & AMP guidelines.

Although several exosome-related databases have been developed, there is still lacking of an integrated database for exosome-based biomarker discovery. To this end, a comprehensive database ExoBCD (https://exobcd.liumwei.org) was constructed with the combination of robust analysis of four high-throughput datasets, transcriptome validation of 1191 TCGA cases and manual mining of 950 studies. In ExoBCD, approximately 20 900 annotation entries were integrated from 25 external sources and 306 exosomal molecules (49 potential biomarkers and 257 biologically interesting molecules). The latter could be divided into 3 molecule types, including 121 mRNAs, 172 miRNAs and 13 lncRNAs.

32639365,A transcriptional toolbox for exploring peripheral neuroimmune interactions.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>Correct communication between immune cells and peripheral neurons is crucial for the protection of our bodies. Its breakdown is observed in many common, often painful conditions, including arthritis, neuropathies, and inflammatory bowel or bladder disease. Here, we have characterised the immune response in a mouse model of neuropathic pain using flow cytometry and cell-type-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found few striking sex differences, but a very persistent inflammatory response, with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages up to 3 1/2 months after the initial injury. This raises the question of whether the commonly used categorisation of pain into ""inflammatory"" and ""neuropathic"" is one that is mechanistically appropriate. Finally, we collated our data with other published RNA-seq data sets on neurons, macrophages, and Schwann cells in naive and nerve injury states. The result is a practical web-based tool for the transcriptional data mining of peripheral neuroimmune interactions. http://rna-seq-browser.herokuapp.com/.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,essentailly a knoweldgebase - all data can be downloaded in excel format

The study of lncRNA-CME associations might help understand lncRNA functions in metastasis and present reliable biomarkers for early dissemination detection and optimized treatment. Therefore, we developed a database named 'lncR2metasta' by manually compiling experimentally supported lncRNAs during various CMEs from existing studies. LncR2metasta documents 1238 associations between 304 lncRNAs and 39 CMEs across 54 human cancer subtypes.

In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the availability of the genome sequence, followed by the resequencing of tomato cultivars and its wild relatives, has provided a prodigious resource for the improvement of traits. A high-quality genome resequencing of 84 tomato accessions and wild relatives generated a dataset that can be used as a resource to identify agronomically important alleles across the genome. Converting this dataset into a searchable database, including information about the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on protein function, provides valuable information about the genetic variations. The database will assist in searching for functional variants of a gene for introgression into tomato cultivars.<h4>Results</h4>A recent release of better-quality tomato genome reference assembly SL3.0, and new annotation ITAG3.2 of SL3.0, dropped 3857 genes, added 4900 novel genes and updated 20 766 genes. Using the above version, we remapped the data from the tomato lines resequenced under the '100 tomato genome resequencing project' on new tomato genome assembly SL3.0 and made an online searchable Tomato Genomic Variations (TGVs) database. The TGV contains information about SNPs and insertion/deletion events and expands it by functional annotation of variants with new ITAG3.2 using SIFT4G software. This database with search function assists in inferring the influence of SNPs on the function of a target gene.

Improvements include ingestion of complex sequence assembly data categories (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies, single cell amplified genomes, and metagenome assembled genomes), prediction of the least common ancestor (LCA) for a peptide shared across multiple organisms, increased performance through updates to the backend architecture, and development of a web portal (https://metatryp.whoi.edu). Major expansion of the marine METATRYP database with predicted proteomes from environmental sequencing confirms a low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics. METATRYP was designed to facilitate ocean metaproteomics and has been integrated into the Ocean Protein Portal (https://oceanproteinportal.org); however, it can be readily applied to other domains. We describe the rapid deployment of a coronavirus-specific web portal (https://metatryp-coronavirus.whoi.edu/) to aid in use of proteomics on coronavirus research during the ongoing pandemic. A coronavirus-focused METATRYP database identified potential SARS-CoV-2 peptide biomarkers and indicated very few shared tryptic peptides between SARS-CoV-2 and other disparate taxa analyzed, sharing <1% peptides with taxa outside of the betacoronavirus group, establishing that taxonomic specificity is achievable using tryptic peptide-based proteomic diagnostic approaches.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

This study was conducted to explore the enset genome to develop molecular markers, genomics resources, and characterize enset landraces while giving insight into the organization of the genome. We identified 233 microsatellites (simple sequence repeats, SSRs) per Mbp in the enset genome, representing 0.28% of the genome. Mono- and di-nucleotide repeats motifs were found in a higher proportion than other classes of SSR-motifs. In total, 154,586 non-redundant enset microsatellite markers (EMM) were identified and 40 selected for primer development.

33045721,ViruSurf: an integrated database to investigate viral sequences.,"ViruSurf, available at http://gmql.eu/virusurf/, is a large public database of viral sequences and integrated and curated metadata from heterogeneous sources (RefSeq, GenBank, COG-UK and NMDC); it also exposes computed nucleotide and amino acid variants, called from original sequences. A GISAID-specific ViruSurf database, available at http://gmql.eu/virusurf_gisaid/, offers a subset of these functionalities. Given the current pandemic outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 data are collected from the four sources; but ViruSurf contains other virus species harmful to humans, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola and Dengue. The database is centered on sequences, described from their biological, technological and organizational dimensions. In addition, the analytical dimension characterizes the sequence in terms of its annotations and variants. The web interface enables expressing complex search queries in a simple way; arbitrary search queries can freely combine conditions on attributes from the four dimensions, extracting the resulting sequences. Several example queries on the database confirm and possibly improve results from recent research papers; results can be recomputed over time and upon selected populations. Effective search over large and curated sequence data may enable faster responses to future threats that could arise from new viruses.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33045737,INTEDE: interactome of drug-metabolizing enzymes.,"Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) are critical determinant of drug safety and efficacy, and the interactome of DMEs has attracted extensive attention. There are 3 major interaction types in an interactome: microbiome-DME interaction (MICBIO), xenobiotics-DME interaction (XEOTIC) and host protein-DME interaction (HOSPPI). The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data. First, 1047 unique DMEs (448 host and 599 microbial) were confirmed, for the first time, using their metabolizing drugs. Second, for these newly confirmed DMEs, all types of their interactions (3359 MICBIOs between 225 microbial species and 185 DMEs; 47 778 XEOTICs between 4150 xenobiotics and 501 DMEs; 7849 HOSPPIs between 565 human proteins and 566 DMEs) were comprehensively collected and then provided, which enabled the crosstalk analysis among multiple types. Because of the huge amount of accumulated data, the INTEDE made it possible to generalize key features for revealing disease etiology and optimizing clinical treatment.

This species is useful in numerous fields, including developmental biology, neurobiology, and ageing. A high-quality comprehensive molecular interaction network is needed to facilitate molecular mechanism studies in C. elegans.<h4>Results</h4>We present the predicted functional interactome of Caenorhabditis elegans (FIC), which integrates functional association data from 10 public databases to infer functional gene interactions on diverse functional perspectives. In this work, FIC includes 108,550 putative functional associations with balanced sensitivity and specificity, which are expected to cover 21.42% of all C. elegans protein interactions, and 29.25% of these associations may represent protein interactions. Based on FIC, we developed a gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) web tool to interpret potential functional impacts from a set of differentially expressed genes observed in transcriptome analyses.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We present the predicted C. elegans interactome database FIC, which is a high-quality database of predicted functional interactions among genes. The functional interactions in FIC serve as a good reference interactome for GSLA to annotate differentially expressed genes for their potential functional impacts. In a case study, the FIC/GSLA system shows more comprehensive and concise annotations compared to other widely used gene set annotation tools, including PANTHER and DAVID.

Further facilitated by their druggability, kinases are a major focus of therapeutic development efforts in diseases such as cancer, infectious disease and autoimmune disorders. While their importance is clear, the role or biological function of nearly one-third of kinases is largely unknown. Here, we describe a data resource, the Dark Kinase Knowledgebase (DKK; https://darkkinome.org), that is specifically focused on providing data and reagents for these understudied kinases to the broader research community. Supported through NIH's Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Program, the DKK is focused on data and knowledge generation for 162 poorly studied or 'dark' kinases. Types of data provided through the DKK include parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) peptides for quantitative proteomics, protein interactions, NanoBRET reagents, and kinase-specific compounds. Higher-level data is similarly being generated and consolidated such as tissue gene expression profiles and, longer-term, functional relationships derived through perturbation studies. Associated web tools that help investigators interrogate both internal and external data are also provided through the site.

The expanding list of lncRNAs and accumulating evidence of their functions in plants have necessitated the creation of a comprehensive database for lncRNA research. However, currently available plant lncRNA databases have some deficiencies, including the lack of lncRNA data from some model plants, uneven annotation standards, a lack of visualization for expression patterns, and the absence of epigenetic information. To overcome these problems, we upgraded our Plant Long noncoding RNA Database (PLncDB, http://plncdb.tobaccodb.org/), which was based on a uniform annotation pipeline. PLncDB V2.0 currently contains 1 246 372 lncRNAs for 80 plant species based on 13 834 RNA-Seq datasets, integrating lncRNA information from four other resources including EVLncRNAs, RNAcentral and etc. Expression patterns and epigenetic signals can be visualized using multiple tools (JBrowse, eFP Browser and EPexplorer). Targets and regulatory networks for lncRNAs are also provided for function exploration. In addition, PLncDB V2.0 is hierarchical and user-friendly and has five built-in search engines. We believe PLncDB V2.0 is useful for the plant lncRNA community and data mining studies and provides a comprehensive resource for data-driven lncRNA research in plants.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

A growing number of examples indicate that such interactions can also rely on intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs), which can form specific reversible interactions not only with proteins but also with lipids. We named IDRs involved in such membrane lipid-induced disorder-to-order transition as MemMoRFs, in an analogy to IDRs exhibiting disorder-to-order transition upon interaction with protein partners termed Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs). Currently, both the experimental detection and computational characterization of MemMoRFs are challenging, and information about these regions are scattered in the literature. To facilitate the related investigations we generated a comprehensive database of experimentally validated MemMoRFs based on manual curation of literature and structural data. To characterize the dynamics of MemMoRFs, secondary structure propensity and flexibility calculated from nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts were incorporated into the database. These data were supplemented by inclusion of sentences from papers, functional data and disease-related information. The MemMoRF database can be accessed via a user-friendly interface at https://memmorf.hegelab.org, potentially providing a central resource for the characterization of disordered regions in transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

33125081,KEGG: integrating viruses and cellular organisms.,"KEGG (https://www.kegg.jp/) is a manually curated resource integrating eighteen databases categorized into systems, genomic, chemical and health information. It also provides KEGG mapping tools, which enable understanding of cellular and organism-level functions from genome sequences and other molecular datasets. KEGG mapping is a predictive method of reconstructing molecular network systems from molecular building blocks based on the concept of functional orthologs. Since the introduction of the KEGG NETWORK database, various diseases have been associated with network variants, which are perturbed molecular networks caused by human gene variants, viruses, other pathogens and environmental factors. The network variation maps are created as aligned sets of related networks showing, for example, how different viruses inhibit or activate specific cellular signaling pathways. The KEGG pathway maps are now integrated with network variation maps in the NETWORK database, as well as with conserved functional units of KEGG modules and reaction modules in the MODULE database. The KO database for functional orthologs continues to be improved and virus KOs are being expanded for better understanding of virus-cell interactions and for enabling prediction of viral perturbations.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

33137192,Plant-ImputeDB: an integrated multiple plant reference panel database for genotype imputation.,"Genotype imputation is a process that estimates missing genotypes in terms of the haplotypes and genotypes in a reference panel. It can effectively increase the density of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), boost the power to identify genetic association and promote the combination of genetic studies. However, there has been a lack of high-quality reference panels for most plants, which greatly hinders the application of genotype imputation. Here, we developed Plant-ImputeDB (http://gong_lab.hzau.edu.cn/Plant_imputeDB/), a comprehensive database with reference panels of 12 plant species for online genotype imputation, SNP and block search and free download. By integrating genotype data and whole-genome resequencing data of plants from various studies and databases, the current Plant-ImputeDB provides high-quality reference panels of 12 plant species, including ‚àº69.9 million SNPs from 34 244 samples. It also provides an easy-to-use online tool with the option of two popular tools specifically designed for genotype imputation. In addition, Plant-ImputeDB accepts submissions of different types of genomic variations, and provides free and open access to all publicly available data in support of related research worldwide. In general, Plant-ImputeDB may serve as an important resource for plant genotype imputation and greatly facilitate the research on plant genetic research.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33147626,CellTalkDB: a manually curated database of ligand-receptor interactions in humans and mice.,"Cell-cell communications in multicellular organisms generally involve secreted ligand-receptor (LR) interactions, which is vital for various biological phenomena. Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have effectively resolved cellular phenotypic heterogeneity and the cell-type composition of complex tissues, facilitating the systematic investigation of cell-cell communications at single-cell resolution. However, assessment of chemical-signal-dependent cell-cell communication through scRNA-seq relies heavily on prior knowledge of LR interaction pairs. We constructed CellTalkDB (http://tcm.zju.edu.cn/celltalkdb), a manually curated comprehensive database of LR interaction pairs in humans and mice comprising 3398 human LR pairs and 2033 mouse LR pairs, through text mining and manual verification of known protein-protein interactions using the STRING database, with literature-supported evidence for each pair. Compared with SingleCellSignalR, the largest LR-pair resource, CellTalkDB includes not only 2033 mouse LR pairs but also 377 additional human LR pairs. In conclusion, the data on human and mouse LR pairs contained in CellTalkDB could help to further the inference and understanding of the LR-interaction-based cell-cell communications, which might provide new insights into the mechanism underlying biological processes.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Moreover, GRNs can be dynamic changing across different conditions, which are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. However, no existing database provides comprehensive GRN information for various human and mouse normal tissues and diseases at the single-cell level. Based on the known TF-target relationships and the large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data collected from public databases as well as the bulk data of The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, we systematically predicted the GRNs of 184 different physiological and pathological conditions of human and mouse involving >633 000 cells and >27 700 bulk samples. We further developed GRNdb, a freely accessible and user-friendly database (http://www.grndb.com/) for searching, comparing, browsing, visualizing, and downloading the predicted information of 77 746 GRNs, 19 687 841 TF-target pairs, and related binding motifs at single-cell/bulk resolution. GRNdb also allows users to explore the gene expression profile, correlations, and the associations between expression levels and the patient survival of diverse cancers. Overall, GRNdb provides a valuable and timely resource to the scientific community to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of gene expression regulation in various conditions.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

33166388,LegumeIP V3: from models to crops-an integrative gene discovery platform for translational genomics in legumes.,"Legumes have contributed to human health, sustainable food and feed production worldwide for centuries. The study of model legumes has played vital roles in deciphering key genes, pathways, and networks regulating biological mechanisms and agronomic traits. Along with emerging breeding technology such as genome editing, translation of the knowledge gained from model plants to crops is in high demand. The updated database (V3) was redesigned for translational genomics targeting the discovery of novel key genes in less-studied non-model legume crops by referring to the knowledge gained in model legumes. The database contains genomic data for all 22 included species, and transcriptomic data covering thousands of RNA-seq samples mostly from model species. The rich biological data and analytic tools for gene expression and pathway analyses can be used to decipher critical genes, pathways, and networks in model legumes. The integrated comparative genomic functions further facilitate the translation of this knowledge to legume crops. Therefore, the database will be a valuable resource to identify important genes regulating specific biological mechanisms or agronomic traits in the non-model yet economically significant legume crops.

The limited size of functional domains and the low level of sequence similarity challenge usual bioinformatics tools. The identification of lectin domains in proteomes requires the manual curation of sequence alignments based on structural folds. A new lectin classification is proposed. It is built on three levels: (i) 35 lectin domain folds, (ii) 109 classes of lectins sharing at least 20% sequence similarity and (iii) 350 families of lectins sharing at least 70% sequence similarity. This information is compiled in the UniLectin platform that includes the previously described UniLectin3D database of curated lectin 3D structures. Since its first release, UniLectin3D has been updated with 485 additional 3D structures.

33175872,High density genotype storage for plant breeding in the Chado schema of Breedbase.,"Modern breeding programs routinely use genome-wide information for selecting individuals to advance. The large volumes of genotypic information required present a challenge for data storage and query efficiency. Major use cases require genotyping data to be linked with trait phenotyping data. In contrast to phenotyping data that are often stored in relational database schemas, next-generation genotyping data are traditionally stored in non-relational storage systems due to their extremely large scope. This study presents a novel data model implemented in Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) for uniting relational phenotyping data and non-relational genotyping data within the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Breedbase is an open-source, web-database designed to manage all of a breeder's informatics needs: management of field experiments, phenotypic and genotypic data collection and storage, and statistical analyses. The genotyping data is stored in a PostgreSQL data-type known as binary JavaScript Object Notation (JSONb), where the JSON structures closely follow the Variant Call Format (VCF) data model. The Breedbase genotyping data model can handle different ploidy levels, structural variants, and any genotype encoded in VCF. JSONb is both compressed and indexed, resulting in a space and time efficient system. Furthermore, file caching maximizes data retrieval performance. Integration of all breeding data within the Chado database schema retains referential integrity that may be lost when genotyping and phenotyping data are stored in separate systems. Benchmarking demonstrates that the system is fast enough for computation of a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) and genome wide association study (GWAS) for datasets involving 1,325 diploid Zea mays, 314 triploid Musa acuminata, and 924 diploid Manihot esculenta samples genotyped with 955,690, 142,119, and 287,952 genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) markers, respectively.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

33301927,Phylogenomic study and classification of mitochondrial DNA through virtual genomic fingerprints.,"In the present study, we evaluated the ability of the Virtual Analysis Method for Phylogenomic fingerprint Estimation (VAMPhyRE) toolkit to classify human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups. In total, 357 random mtDNA sequences were obtained from different haplogroups, based on the classification of PhyloTree. Additionally, we included a control group of five sequences (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, Yoruba15, and the revised Cambridge reference sequence). VAMPhyRE employs a virtual hybridization technique, using probes that specifically bind to their complementary sequences in the genome. We used 65,536 probes of 8 nucleotides to identify potential sites where hybridization occurs between the mtDNA and the specific probe, forming different heteroduplexes and thus, creating a unique and specific genomic fingerprint for each sequence. Genomic fingerprints were compared, and a table of distances was calculated to obtain a mitochondrial phylogenomic tree with the macrohaplogroups, L, N, M, and R, and their corresponding haplogroups, according to universal nomenclature. The results obtained suggest an accuracy of 97.25% for the distribution of the 357 mtDNA sequences in the four macrohaplogroups and their corresponding haplogroups when compared with other mtDNA classification tools that require reference sequences and do not offer an analysis based on an evolutionary approach.

Due to their coordinative role in adaptive immune responses, DCs have been used as cell-based therapeutic vaccination against cancer. The capacity of DCs to induce a therapeutic immune response can be enhanced by re-wiring of cellular signalling pathways with microRNAs (miRNAs). <b>Methods:</b> Since the activation and maturation of DCs is controlled by an interconnected signalling network, we deploy an approach that combines RNA sequencing data and systems biology methods to delineate miRNA-based strategies that enhance DC-elicited immune responses. <b>Results:</b> Through RNA sequencing of IKKŒ≤-matured DCs that are currently being tested in a clinical trial on therapeutic anti-cancer vaccination, we identified 44 differentially expressed miRNAs. According to a network analysis, most of these miRNAs regulate targets that are linked to immune pathways, such as cytokine and interleukin signalling. We employed a network topology-oriented scoring model to rank the miRNAs, analysed their impact on immunogenic potency of DCs, and identified dozens of promising miRNA candidates, with miR-15a and miR-16 as the top ones. The results of our analysis are presented in a database that constitutes a tool to identify DC-relevant miRNA-gene interactions with therapeutic potential (https://www.synmirapy.net/dc-optimization). <b>Conclusions:</b> Our approach enables the systematic analysis and identification of functional miRNA-gene interactions that can be experimentally tested for improving DC immunogenic potency.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Here, we report a web-based rapeseed genomic variation database (BnaGVD, http://rapeseed.biocloud.net/home) from which genomic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) across a world-wide collection of rapeseed accessions, can be referred. The current release of the BnaGVD contains 34,591,899 high-quality SNPs and 12,281,923 high-quality InDels and provides search tools to retrieve genomic variations and gene annotations across 1,007 accessions of worldwide rapeseed germplasm. We implement a variety of built-in tools (e.g., BnaGWAS, BnaPCA, and BnaStructure) to help users perform in-depth analyses. We recommend this web resource for accelerating studies on the functional genomics and screening of molecular markers for rapeseed breeding.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33401309,ADeditome provides the genomic landscape of A-to-I RNA editing in Alzheimer's disease.,"A-to-I RNA editing, contributing to nearly 90% of all editing events in human, has been reported to involve in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its roles in brain development and immune regulation, such as the deficient editing of GluA2 Q/R related to cell death and memory loss. Currently, there are urgent needs for the systematic annotations of A-to-I RNA editing events in AD. Here, we built ADeditome, the annotation database of A-to-I RNA editing in AD available at https://ccsm.uth.edu/ADeditome, aiming to provide a resource and reference for functional annotation of A-to-I RNA editing in AD to identify therapeutically targetable genes in an individual. We detected 1676 363 editing sites in 1524 samples across nine brain regions from ROSMAP, MayoRNAseq and MSBB. For these editing events, we performed multiple functional annotations including identification of specific and disease stage associated editing events and the influence of editing events on gene expression, protein recoding, alternative splicing and miRNA regulation for all the genes, especially for AD-related genes in order to explore the pathology of AD. Combing all the analysis results, we found 108 010 and 26 168 editing events which may promote or inhibit AD progression, respectively. We also found 5582 brain region-specific editing events with potentially dual roles in AD across different brain regions. ADeditome will be a unique resource for AD and drug research communities to identify therapeutically targetable editing events. Significance: ADeditome is the first comprehensive resource of the functional genomics of individual A-to-I RNA editing events in AD, which will be useful for many researchers in the fields of AD pathology, precision medicine, and therapeutic researches.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33416858,The iPPI-DB initiative: A Community-centered database of Protein-Protein Interaction modulators.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>One avenue to address the paucity of clinically testable targets is to reinvestigate the druggable genome by tackling complicated types of targets such as Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs). Given the challenge to target those interfaces with small chemical compounds, it has become clear that learning from successful examples of PPI modulation is a powerful strategy. Freely-accessible databases of PPI modulators that provide the community with tractable chemical and pharmacological data, as well as powerful tools to query them, are therefore essential to stimulate new drug discovery projects on PPI targets.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the new version iPPI-DB, our manually curated database of PPI modulators. In this completely redesigned version of the database, we introduce a new web interface relying on crowdsourcing for the maintenance of the database. This interface was created to enable community contributions, whereby external experts can suggest new database entries. Moreover, the data model, the graphical interface, and the tools to query the database have been completely modernized and improved. We added new PPI modulators, new PPI targets, and extended our focus to stabilizers of PPIs as well.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The iPPI-DB server is available at https://ippidb.pasteur.fr The source code for this server is available at https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/ippidb/ippidb-web/ and is distributed under GPL licence (http://www.gnu.org/licences/gpl).

There are a few known biological switches that have been well characterized, however these examples are insufficient for systematic surveys of properties of these important systems. Here we present a resource of all possible bistable biochemical reaction networks with up to 6 reactions between 3 molecules, and 3 reactions between 4 molecules. Over 35,000 reaction topologies were constructed by identifying unique combinations of reactions between a fixed number of molecules. Then, these topologies were populated with rates within a biologically realistic range. The Searchable Web Interface for Topologies of CHEmical Switches (SWITCHES, https://switches.ncbs.res.in) provides a bistability and parameter analysis of over 7 million models from this systematic survey of chemical reaction space. This database will be useful for theoreticians interested in analyzing stability in chemical systems and also experimentalists for creating robust synthetic biological switches.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Freely available on the web at https://switches.ncbs.res.in.

33461215,Ligand-based approach for predicting drug targets and for virtual screening against COVID-19.,"Discovering efficient drugs and identifying target proteins are still an unmet but urgent need for curing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Protein structure-based docking is a widely applied approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has its inherent deficiency caused by e.g. various different conformations with largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results. As a complementary approach to the protein structure-based platform for COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our previous work, we developed in this study a ligand-based method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound database. The database is constituted by all the reported bioactive molecules against the coronaviruses, viz., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), some of which have target or mechanism information but some do not. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) similarity evaluation of molecular structures, virtual screening and target prediction could be performed according to similarity ranking results. With two examples, we demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of D3Similarity by using 2D‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ3D value as score for drug discovery and target prediction against COVID-19. The database, which will be updated regularly, is available free of charge at https://www.d3pharma.com/D3Targets-2019-nCoV/D3Similarity/index.php.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

New approaches are urgently needed to prioritize variants, especially those that are rare or lack a definitive clinical interpretation. We examined 10,136,597 human missense genetic variants from GnomAD, ClinVar and UniProt. We were able to perform large-scale atom-based mapping and phenotype interpretation of 3,960,015 of these variants onto 18,874 experimental and 84,818 in house predicted three-dimensional coordinates of the human proteome. We demonstrate that 14% of amino acid substitutions from the GnomAD database that could be structurally analysed are predicted to affect protein structure (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ568,548, of which 566,439 rare or extremely rare) and may, therefore, have a yet unknown disease-causing effect. The same is true for 19.0% (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ6266) of variants of unknown clinical significance or conflicting interpretation reported in the ClinVar database. The results of the structural analysis are available in the dedicated web catalogue Missense3D-DB ( http://missense3d.bc.ic.ac.uk/ ). For each of the 4 M variants, the results of the structural analysis are presented in a friendly concise format that can be included in clinical genetic reports. A detailed report of the structural analysis is also available for the non-experts in structural biology. Population frequency and predictions from SIFT and PolyPhen are included for a more comprehensive variant interpretation. This is the first large-scale atom-based structural interpretation of human genetic variation and offers geneticists and the biomedical community a new approach to genetic variant interpretation.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33507270,InSexBase: an annotated genomic resource of sex chromosomes and sex-biased genes in insects.,"Sex determination and the regulation of sexual dimorphism are among the most fascinating topics in modern biology. As the most species-rich group of sexually reproducing organisms on Earth, insects have multiple sex determination systems. Though sex chromosomes and sex-biased genes are well-studied in dozens of insects, their gene sequences are scattered in various databases. Moreover, a shortage of annotation hinders the deep mining of these data. Here, we collected the chromosome-level sex chromosome data of 49 insect species, including 34 X chromosomes, 15 Z chromosomes, 5 W chromosomes and 2 Y chromosomes. We also obtained Y-linked contigs of four insects species-Anopheles gambiae, Drosophila innubila, Drosophila yakuba and Tribolium castaneum. The unannotated chromosome-level sex chromosomes were annotated using a standard pipeline, yielding a total of 123‚Äâ030 protein-coding genes, 2‚Äâ159‚Äâ427 repeat sequences, 894 miRNAs, 1574 rRNAs, 5105 tRNAs, 395 snoRNAs (small nucleolar RNA), 54 snRNAs (small nuclear RNA) and 5959 other ncRNAs (non-coding RNA). In addition, 36‚Äâ781 sex-biased genes were identified by analyzing 62 RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) datasets. Together with 5707 sex-biased genes from the Drosophila genus collected from the Sex-Associated Gene Database, we obtained a total of 42‚Äâ488 sex-biased genes from 13 insect species.

To control this pest, scientists have accumulated a great deal of high-throughput data of fall armyworm, and nine versions of its genomes and transcriptomes have been published. However, easily accessing and performing integrated analysis of these omics data sets is challenging. Here, we developed the Fall Armyworm Genome Database (FAWMine, http://159.226.67.243:8080/fawmine/) to maintain genome sequences, structural and functional annotations, transcriptomes, co-expression, protein interactions, homologs, pathways, and single-nucleotide variations.

However, current human-virus PPI database resources are incomplete, lack annotation and usually do not provide the opportunity to computationally predict human-virus PPIs. Here, we present the Human-Virus Interaction DataBase (HVIDB, http://zzdlab.com/hvidb/) that provides comprehensively annotated human-virus PPI data as well as seamlessly integrates online PPI prediction tools. Currently, HVIDB highlights 48 643 experimentally verified human-virus PPIs covering 35 virus families, 6633 virally targeted host complexes, 3572 host dependency/restriction factors as well as 911 experimentally verified/predicted 3D complex structures of human-virus PPIs. Furthermore, our database resource provides tissue-specific expression profiles of 6790 human genes that are targeted by viruses and 129 Gene Expression Omnibus series of differentially expressed genes post-viral infections. Based on these multifaceted and annotated data, our database allows the users to easily obtain reliable information about PPIs of various human viruses and conduct an in-depth analysis of their inherent biological significance. In particular, HVIDB also integrates well-performing machine learning models to predict interactions between the human host and viral proteins that are based on (i) sequence embedding techniques, (ii) interolog mapping and (iii) domain-domain interaction inference. We anticipate that HVIDB will serve as a one-stop knowledge base to further guide hypothesis-driven experimental efforts to investigate human-virus relationships.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Since amino acid changes affect protein function through mechanisms often predictable from protein structure, the integration of structural and sequence data enables us to estimate with greater accuracy whether and how a given mutation will lead to disease. Publicly available annotated databases enable hypothesis assessment and benchmarking of prediction tools. However, the results are often presented as summary statistics or black box predictors, without providing full descriptive information. We developed a new semi-manually curated human variant database presenting information on the protein contact-map, sequence-to-structure mapping, amino acid identity change, and stability prediction for the popular UniProt database.

Proteins of unknown function (PUFs) are interesting targets for GM crops breeding pipelines for the novelty associated with such targets and also to avoid copyright protection. One method of inferring the putative function of PUFs is by relating them to factors of interest such as abiotic stresses using orthology and co-expression networks, in a guilt-by-association manner. In this regard, we have downloaded, analyzed, and processed genomics data of 53 angiosperms, totaling 1,862,010 genes and 2,332,974 RNA. Diamond and InterproScan were used to discover 72,266 PUFs for all organisms. RNA-seq datasets related to abiotic stresses were downloaded from NCBI/GEO. The RNA-seq data was used as input to the LSTrAP software to construct co-expression networks. LSTrAP also created clusters of transcripts with correlated expression, whose members are more probably related to the molecular mechanisms associated with abiotic stresses in the plants. Orthologous groups were created (OrhtoMCL) using all 2,332,974 proteins in order to associate PUFs to abiotic stress-related clusters of co-expression and therefore infer their function in a guilt-by-association manner. A freely available web resource named ""Plant Co-expression Annotation Resource"" ( https://www.machado.cnptia.embrapa.br/plantannot ), Plantannot, was created to provide indexed queries to search for PUF putatively associated with abiotic stresses. The web interface also allows browsing, querying, and retrieving of public genomics data from 53 plants.

Information on hereditary diseases, DNA tests, genetic testing laboratories and afflicted breeds added to the web-based WSAVA-PennGen DNA Testing Database was gathered. Following verification through original research and clinical studies, searching various databases on hereditary diseases in dogs and cats, and contacting laboratories offering DNA tests, the data were compared to the resource reported on in 2013. The number of molecularly defined Mendelian inherited diseases and variants in companion animals listed in the WSAVA-PennGen DNA Testing Database in 2020 drastically increased by 112% and 141%, respectively. The number of DNA variant tests offered by each laboratory has also doubled for dogs and cats.

33643383,Abiotic Stress-Responsive miRNA and Transcription Factor-Mediated Gene Regulatory Network in <i>Oryza sativa</i>: Construction and Structural Measure Study.,"Climate changes and environmental stresses have a consequential association with crop plant growth and yield, meaning it is necessary to cultivate crops that have tolerance toward the changing climate and environmental disturbances such as water stress, temperature fluctuation, and salt toxicity. Recent studies have shown that trans-acting regulatory elements, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs), are emerging as promising tools for engineering naive improved crop varieties with tolerance for multiple environmental stresses and enhanced quality as well as yield. However, the interwoven complex regulatory function of TFs and miRNAs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is unexplored in <i>Oryza sativa</i>. To this end, we have constructed a multiple abiotic stress responsive TF-miRNA-gene regulatory network for <i>O. sativa</i> using a transcriptome and degradome sequencing data meta-analysis approach. The theoretical network approach has shown the networks to be dense, scale-free, and small-world, which makes the network stable. They are also invariant to scale change where an efficient, quick transmission of biological signals occurs within the network on extrinsic hindrance. The analysis also deciphered the existence of communities (cluster of TF, miRNA, and genes) working together to help plants in acclimatizing to multiple stresses. It highlighted that genes, TFs, and miRNAs shared by multiple stress conditions that work as hubs or bottlenecks for signal propagation, for example, during the interaction between stress-responsive genes (TFs/miRNAs/other genes) and genes involved in floral development pathways under multiple environmental stresses. This study further highlights how the fine-tuning feedback mechanism works for balancing stress tolerance and how timely flowering enable crops to survive in adverse conditions. This study developed the abiotic stress-responsive regulatory network, APRegNet database (http://lms.snu.edu.in/APRegNet), which may help researchers studying the roles of miRNAs and TFs. Furthermore, it advances current understanding of multiple abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33655207,TMSNP: a web server to predict pathogenesis of missense mutations in the transmembrane region of membrane proteins.,"The massive amount of data generated from genome sequencing brings tons of newly identified mutations, whose pathogenic/non-pathogenic effects need to be evaluated. This has given rise to several mutation predictor tools that, in general, do not consider the specificities of the various protein groups. We aimed to develop a predictor tool dedicated to membrane proteins, under the premise that their specific structural features and environment would give different responses to mutations compared to globular proteins. For this purpose, we created TMSNP, a database that currently contains information from 2624 pathogenic and 196 705 non-pathogenic reported mutations located in the transmembrane region of membrane proteins. By computing various conservation parameters on these mutations in combination with annotations, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify mutations as pathogenic or not. TMSNP (freely available at http://lmc.uab.es/tmsnp/) improves considerably the prediction power of commonly used mutation predictors trained with globular proteins.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,software,

However, none of these has yet collected experimental results of compound-related health changes. Since quality of life is often regarded as more valuable than length of life, we aim to fill this gap with the ""Healthy Worm Database"" ( http://healthy-worm-database.eu ). Literature describing health-related compound studies in the aging model Caenorhabditis elegans was screened, and data for 440 compounds collected. The database considers 189 publications describing 89 different phenotypes measured in 2995 different conditions. Besides enabling a targeted search for promising compounds for further investigations, this database also offers insights into the research field of studies on healthy aging based on a frequently used model organism. Some weaknesses of C. elegans-based aging studies, like underrepresented phenotypes, especially concerning cognitive functions, as well as the convenience-based use of young worms as the starting point for compound treatment or phenotype measurement are discussed. In conclusion, the database provides an anchor for the search for compounds affecting health, with a link to public databases, and it further highlights some potential shortcomings in current aging research.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33685383,lncRNADetector: a bioinformatics pipeline for long non-coding RNA identification and MAPslnc: a repository of medicinal and aromatic plant lncRNAs.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs and potent regulatory elements in the living cells. High throughput RNA sequencing analyses have generated a tremendous amount of transcript sequence data. A large proportion of these transcript sequences does not code for proteins and are known as non-coding RNAs. Among them, lncRNAs are a unique class of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with diverse biological functions and regulatory mechanisms. Recent emerging studies and next-generation sequencing technologies show a substantial amount of lncRNAs within the plant genome, which are yet to be identified. The computational identification of lncRNAs from these transcripts is a challenging task due to the involvement of a series of filtering steps. We have developed lncRNADetector, a bioinformatics pipeline for the identification of novel lncRNAs, especially from medicinal and aromatic plant (MAP) species. The lncRNADetector has been utilized to analyse and identify more than 88,459 lncRNAs from 21 species of MAPs. To provide a knowledge resource for the plant research community towards elucidating the diversity of biological roles of lncRNAs, the information generated about MAP lncRNAs (post-filtering steps) through lncRNADetector has been stored and organized in MAPslnc database (MAPslnc, https://lncrnapipe.cimap.res.in). The lncRNADetector web server and MAPslnc database have been developed in order to facilitate researchers for accurate identification of lncRNAs from the next-generation sequencing data of different organisms for downstream studies. To the best of our knowledge no such MAPslnc database is available till date.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

33705530,Development of a biomarker database toward performing disease classification and finding disease interrelations.,"A biomarker is a measurable indicator of a disease or abnormal state of a body that plays an important role in disease diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. The biomarker has become a significant topic due to its versatile usage in the medical field and in rapid detection of the presence or severity of some diseases. The volume of biomarker data is rapidly increasing and the identified data are scattered. To provide comprehensive information, the explosively growing data need to be recorded in a single platform. There is no open-source freely available comprehensive online biomarker database. To fulfill this purpose, we have developed a human biomarker database as part of the KNApSAcK family databases which contain a vast quantity of information on the relationships between biomarkers and diseases. We have classified the diseases into 18 disease classes, mostly according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information definitions. Apart from this database development, we also have performed disease classification by separately using protein and metabolite biomarkers based on the network clustering algorithm DPClusO and hierarchical clustering. Finally, we reached a conclusion about the relationships among the disease classes. The human biomarker database can be accessed online and the inter-disease relationships may be helpful in understanding the molecular mechanisms of diseases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first approaches to classify diseases based on biomarkers. Database URL:  http://www.knapsackfamily.com/Biomarker/top.php.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

In order to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and developing drug against COVID-19, a vast amount of genomic, proteomic, interatomic, and clinical data is being generated, and the bioinformatics researchers produced databases, webservers and tools to gather those publicly available data and provide an opportunity of analyzing such data. However, these bioinformatics resources are scattered and researchers need to find them from different resources discretely. To facilitate researchers in finding the resources in one frame, we have developed an integrated web portal called OverCOVID (http://bis.zju.edu.cn/overcovid/). The publicly available webservers, databases and tools associated with SARS-CoV-2 have been incorporated in the resource page. In addition, a network view of the resources is provided to display the scope of the research.

Applied to single-cell data, such analyses provide mechanistic insights into individual cells and their interactions. However, knowledge of intercellular communication is scarce, scattered across resources, and not linked to intracellular processes. To address this gap, we combined over 100 resources covering interactions and roles of proteins in inter- and intracellular signaling, as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We added protein complex information and annotations on function, localization, and role in diseases for each protein. The resource is available for human, and via homology translation for mouse and rat. The data are accessible via OmniPath's web service (https://omnipathdb.org/), a Cytoscape plug-in, and packages in R/Bioconductor and Python, providing access options for computational and experimental scientists. We created workflows with tutorials to facilitate the analysis of cell-cell interactions and affected downstream intracellular signaling processes. OmniPath provides a single access point to knowledge spanning intra- and intercellular processes for data analysis, as we demonstrate in applications studying SARS-CoV-2 infection and ulcerative colitis.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33757430,ATAV: a comprehensive platform for population-scale genomic analyses.,"<h4>Background</h4>A common approach for sequencing studies is to do joint-calling and store variants of all samples in a single file. If new samples are continually added or controls are re-used for several studies, the cost and time required to perform joint-calling for each analysis can become prohibitive.<h4>Results</h4>We present ATAV, an analysis platform for large-scale whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing projects. ATAV stores variant and per site coverage data for all samples in a centralized database, which is efficiently queried by ATAV to support diagnostic analyses for trios and singletons, as well as rare-variant collapsing analyses for finding disease associations in complex diseases. Runtime logs ensure full reproducibility and the modularized ATAV framework makes it extensible to continuous development. Besides helping with the identification of disease-causing variants for a range of diseases, ATAV has also enabled the discovery of disease-genes by rare-variant collapsing on datasets containing more than 20,000 samples. Analyses to date have been performed on data of more than 110,000 individuals demonstrating the scalability of the framework. To allow users to easily access variant-level data directly from the database, we provide a web-based interface, the ATAV data browser ( http://atavdb.org/ ). Through this browser, summary-level data for more than 40,000 samples can be queried by the general public representing a mix of cases and controls of diverse ancestries. Users have access to phenotype categories of variant carriers, as well as predicted ancestry, gender, and quality metrics. In contrast to many other platforms, the data browser is able to show data of newly-added samples in real-time and therefore evolves rapidly as more and more samples are sequenced.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Through ATAV, users have public access to one of the largest variant databases for patients sequenced at a tertiary care center and can look up any genes or variants of interest. Additionally, since the entire code is freely available on GitHub, ATAV can easily be deployed by other groups that wish to build their own platform, database, and user interface.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

All data are provided as an online resource (https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/MRECA/Nephron/). Many of the genes expressed in unique patterns along the renal tubule were solute carriers, transcription factors, or G protein-coupled receptors that account for segment-specific function. Mapping the distribution of transcripts associated with Wnk-SPAK-PKA signaling, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone signaling, and cystic diseases of the kidney illustrated the applications of the online resource. The method allowed full-length mapping of RNA-seq reads, which facilitated comprehensive, unbiased characterization of alternative exon usage along the renal tubule, including known isoforms of <i>Cldn10</i>, <i>Kcnj1</i> (ROMK), <i>Slc12a1</i> (NKCC2), <i>Wnk1</i>, <i>Stk39</i> (SPAK), and <i>Slc14a2</i> (UT-A urea transporter). It also identified many novel isoforms with segment-specific distribution. These included variants associated with altered protein structure (<i>Slc9a8</i>, <i>Khk</i>, <i>Tsc22d1</i>, and <i>Scoc</i>), and variants that may affect untranslated, regulatory regions of transcripts (<i>Pth1r</i>, <i>Pkar1a</i>, and <i>Dab2</i>).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Full-length, unbiased sequencing of transcripts identified gene-expression patterns along the mouse renal tubule. The data, provided as an online resource, include both quantitative and qualitative differences in transcripts. Identification of alternative splicing along the renal tubule may prove critical to understanding renal physiology and pathophysiology.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Similarly, users can easily navigate the IEDB's simplified NCBI taxonomy hierarchy to locate proteins from specific organisms. However, some epitopes are non-peptidic, such as carbohydrates, lipids, chemicals and drugs, and it is more challenging to consistently name them and search upon, making access to their data more problematic for immunologists. Therefore, we set out to improve access to non-peptidic epitope data in the IEDB through the simplification of the non-peptidic hierarchy used in our search interfaces.

33780471,MCPdb: The bacterial microcompartment database.,"Bacterial microcompartments are organelle-like structures composed entirely of proteins. They have evolved to carry out several distinct and specialized metabolic functions in a wide variety of bacteria. Their outer shell is constructed from thousands of tessellating protein subunits, encapsulating enzymes that carry out the internal metabolic reactions. The shell proteins are varied, with single, tandem and permuted versions of the PF00936 protein family domain comprising the primary structural component of their polyhedral architecture, which is reminiscent of a viral capsid. While considerable amounts of structural and biophysical data have been generated in the last 15 years, the existing functionalities of current resources have limited our ability to rapidly understand the functional and structural properties of microcompartments (MCPs) and their diversity. In order to make the remarkable structural features of bacterial microcompartments accessible to a broad community of scientists and non-specialists, we developed MCPdb: The Bacterial Microcompartment Database (https://mcpdb.mbi.ucla.edu/). MCPdb is a comprehensive resource that categorizes and organizes known microcompartment protein structures and their larger assemblies. To emphasize the critical roles symmetric assembly and architecture play in microcompartment function, each structure in the MCPdb is validated and annotated with respect to: (1) its predicted natural assembly state (2) tertiary structure and topology and (3) the metabolic compartment type from which it derives. The current database includes 163 structures and is available to the public with the anticipation that it will serve as a growing resource for scientists interested in understanding protein-based metabolic organelles in bacteria.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

These increases in volume, diversity and complexity of the data generated and their analysis expose the necessity of a structured and standardized reporting template. BioCompute Objects (BCOs) provide the requisite support for communication of HTS data analysis that includes support for workflow, as well as data, curation, accessibility and reproducibility of communication. BCOs standardize how researchers report provenance and the established verification and validation protocols used in workflows while also being robust enough to convey content integration or curation in knowledge bases. BCOs that encapsulate tools, platforms, datasets and workflows are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) compliant. Providing operational workflow and data information facilitates interoperability between platforms and incorporation of future dataset within an HTS analysis for use within industrial, academic and regulatory settings. Cloud-based platforms, including High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) and Galaxy, support BCO generation for users. Given the 100K+ userbase between these platforms, BioCompute can be leveraged for workflow documentation. In this paper, we report the availability of platform-dependent and platform-independent BCO tools: HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App, Galaxy BCO API Extension and BCO Portal. Community engagement was utilized to evaluate tool efficacy. We demonstrate that these tools further advance BCO creation from text editing approaches used in earlier releases of the standard. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating BCO generation within existing analysis platforms greatly streamlines BCO creation while capturing granular workflow details. We also demonstrate that the BCO tools described in the paper provide an approach to solve the long-standing challenge of standardizing workflow descriptions that are both human and machine readable while accommodating manual and automated curation with evidence tagging.

33843105,Sequence and evolutionary analysis of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins.,"The multi-domain bacterial S1 protein is the largest and most functionally important ribosomal protein of the 30S subunit, which interacts with both mRNA and proteins. The family of ribosomal S1 proteins differs in the classical sense from a protein with tandem repeats and has a ""bead-on-string"" organization, where each repeat is folded into a globular domain. Based on our recent data, the study of evolutionary relationships for the bacterial phyla will provide evidence for one of the proposed theories of the evolutionary development of proteins with structural repeats: from multiple repeats of assembles to single repeats, or vice versa. In this comparative analysis of 1333 S1 sequences that were identified in 24 different phyla, we demonstrate how such phyla can form independently/dependently during evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study of the evolutionary history of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins. The collected and structured data can be useful to computer biologists as a resource for determining percent identity, amino acid composition and logo motifs, as well as dN/dS ratio in bacterial S1 protein. The obtained research data indicate that the evolutionary development of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins evolved from multiple assemblies to single repeat.

The goal of those studies is to translate the findings from in vitro studies of cancer cell lines into in vivo therapeutic relevance and, eventually, patients' care. Tremendous progress has been made.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, we built predictive models for 453 drugs using data on gene expression and drug sensitivity (IC<sub>50</sub>) from cancer cell lines. We identified many known drug-gene interactions and uncovered several potentially novel drug-gene associations. Importantly, we further applied these predictive models to ~‚Äâ17,000 bulk RNA-seq samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to predict drug sensitivity for both normal and tumor tissues. We created a web site for users to visualize and download our predicted data ( https://manticore.niehs.nih.gov/cancerRxTissue ). Using trametinib as an example, we showed that our approach can faithfully recapitulate the known tumor specificity of the drug.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that our approach can predict drugs that 1) are tumor-type specific; 2) elicit higher sensitivity from tumor compared to corresponding normal tissue; 3) elicit differential sensitivity across breast cancer subtypes. If validated, our prediction could have relevance for preclinical drug testing and in phase I clinical design.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33858848,HLA Ligand Atlas: a benign reference of HLA-presented peptides to improve T-cell-based cancer immunotherapy.,"<h4>Background</h4>The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex controls adaptive immunity by presenting defined fractions of the intracellular and extracellular protein content to immune cells. Understanding the benign HLA ligand repertoire is a prerequisite to define safe T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer. Due to the poor availability of benign tissues, if available, normal tissue adjacent to the tumor has been used as a benign surrogate when defining tumor-associated antigens. However, this comparison has proven to be insufficient and even resulted in lethal outcomes. In order to match the tumor immunopeptidome with an equivalent counterpart, we created the HLA Ligand Atlas, the first extensive collection of paired HLA-I and HLA-II immunopeptidomes from 227 benign human tissue samples. This dataset facilitates a balanced comparison between tumor and benign tissues on HLA ligand level.<h4>Methods</h4>Human tissue samples were obtained from 16 subjects at autopsy, five thymus samples and two ovary samples originating from living donors. HLA ligands were isolated via immunoaffinity purification and analyzed in over 1200 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry runs. Experimentally and computationally reproducible protocols were employed for data acquisition and processing.<h4>Results</h4>The initial release covers 51 HLA-I and 86 HLA-II allotypes presenting 90,428 HLA-I- and 142,625 HLA-II ligands. The HLA allotypes are representative for the world population. We observe that immunopeptidomes differ considerably between tissues and individuals on source protein and HLA-ligand level. Moreover, we discover 1407 HLA-I ligands from non-canonical genomic regions. Such peptides were previously described in tumors, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), healthy lung tissues and cell lines. In a case study in glioblastoma, we show that potential on-target off-tumor adverse events in immunotherapy can be avoided by comparing tumor immunopeptidomes to the provided multi-tissue reference.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Given that T-cell-based immunotherapies, such as CAR-T cells, affinity-enhanced T cell transfer, cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibition, have significant side effects, the HLA Ligand Atlas is the first step toward defining tumor-associated targets with an improved safety profile. The resource provides insights into basic and applied immune-associated questions in the context of cancer immunotherapy, infection, transplantation, allergy and autoimmunity.

33876217,CanDriS: posterior profiling of cancer-driving sites based on two-component evolutionary model.,"Current cancer genomics databases have accumulated millions of somatic mutations that remain to be further explored. Due to the over-excess mutations unrelated to cancer, the great challenge is to identify somatic mutations that are cancer-driven. Under the notion that carcinogenesis is a form of somatic-cell evolution, we developed a two-component mixture model: while the ground component corresponds to passenger mutations, the rapidly evolving component corresponds to driver mutations. Then, we implemented an empirical Bayesian procedure to calculate the posterior probability of a site being cancer-driven. Based on these, we developed a software CanDriS (Cancer Driver Sites) to profile the potential cancer-driving sites for thousands of tumor samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium across tumor types and pan-cancer level. As a result, we identified that approximately 1% of the sites have posterior probabilities larger than 0.90 and listed potential cancer-wide and cancer-specific driver mutations. By comprehensively profiling all potential cancer-driving sites, CanDriS greatly enhances our ability to refine our knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer and might guide clinical medication in the upcoming era of precision medicine.

The goal of PhenX is to facilitate the use of standard measures, enhance data interoperability, and promote collaborative and translational research. PhenX is driven by the scientific community and historically has depended on working groups of experts to recommend measures for release in the PhenX Toolkit. The urgent need for recommended, standard measures for COVID-19 research triggered the development of a ""rapid release"" process for releasing new content in the PhenX Toolkit. Initially, PhenX collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the NIH Disaster Research Response (DR2) program to create a library of COVID-19 measurement protocols. With additional support from NIH, PhenX adapted crowdsourcing techniques to accelerate prioritization and recommendation of protocols for release in the PhenX Toolkit. Prioritized COVID-19-specific protocols were used to anchor and define specialty collections of protocols that were subject to review and approval by the PhenX Steering Committee. In addition to the COVID-19-specific protocols, the specialty collections include existing, well-established PhenX protocols, use of which will further enhance data interoperability and cross-study analysis.

33929905,Risk-Based Chemical Ranking and Generating a Prioritized Human Exposome Database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Due to the ubiquitous use of chemicals in modern society, humans are increasingly exposed to thousands of chemicals that contribute to a major portion of the human exposome. Should a comprehensive and risk-based human exposome database be created, it would be conducive to the rapid progress of human exposomics research. In addition, once a xenobiotic is biotransformed with distinct half-lives upon exposure, monitoring the parent compounds alone may not reflect the actual human exposure. To address these questions, a comprehensive and risk-prioritized human exposome database is needed.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our objective was to set up a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database including physicochemical properties as well as risk prediction and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that has the ability to conduct searches for content associated with chemicals in our database.<h4>Methods</h4>We built a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database by text mining and database fusion. Subsequently, chemicals were prioritized by integrating exposure level obtained from the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models with toxicity data predicted by the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool and the Toxicological Priority Index calculated from the ToxCast database. The biotransformation half-lives (HLBs) of all the chemicals were assessed using the Iterative Fragment Selection approach and biotransformation products were predicted using the previously developed BioTransformer machine-learning method.<h4>Results</h4>We compiled a human exposome database of >20,000 chemicals, prioritized 13,441 chemicals based on probabilistic hazard quotient and 7,770 chemicals based on risk index, and provided a predicted biotransformation metabolite database of >95,000 metabolites. In addition, a user-interactive Java software (Oracle)-based search GUI was generated to enable open access to this new resource.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our database can be used to guide chemical management and enhance scientific understanding to rapidly and effectively prioritize chemicals for comprehensive biomonitoring in epidemiological investigations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7722.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33942874,Human IRES Atlas: an integrative platform for studying IRES-driven translational regulation in humans.,"It is now known that cap-independent translation initiation facilitated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) is vital in selective cellular protein synthesis under stress and different physiological conditions. However, three problems make it hard to understand transcriptome-wide cellular IRES-mediated translation initiation mechanisms: (i) complex interplay between IRESs and other translation initiation-related information, (ii) reliability issue of in silico cellular IRES investigation and (iii) labor-intensive in vivo IRES identification. In this research, we constructed the Human IRES Atlas database for a comprehensive understanding of cellular IRESs in humans. First, currently available and suitable IRES prediction tools (IRESfinder, PatSearch and IRESpy) were used to obtain transcriptome-wide human IRESs. Then, we collected eight genres of translation initiation-related features to help study the potential molecular mechanisms of each of the putative IRESs. Three functional tests (conservation, structural RNA-protein scores and conditional translation efficiency) were devised to evaluate the functionality of the identified putative IRESs. Moreover, an easy-to-use interface and an IRES-translation initiation interaction map for each gene transcript were implemented to help understand the interactions between IRESs and translation initiation-related features. Researchers can easily search/browse an IRES of interest using the web interface and deduce testable mechanism hypotheses of human IRES-driven translation initiation based on the integrated results. In summary, Human IRES Atlas integrates putative IRES elements and translation initiation-related experiments for better usage of these data and deduction of mechanism hypotheses.

33950201,Trips-Viz: an environment for the analysis of public and user-generated ribosome profiling data.,"Trips-Viz (https://trips.ucc.ie/) is an interactive platform for the analysis and visualization of ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) and shotgun RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. This includes publicly available and user generated data, hence Trips-Viz can be classified as a database and as a server. As a database it provides access to many processed Ribo-Seq and RNA-seq data aligned to reference transcriptomes which has been expanded considerably since its inception. Here, we focus on the server functionality of Trips-viz which also has been greatly improved. Trips-viz now enables visualisation of proteomics data from a large number of processed mass spectrometry datasets. It can be used to support translation inferred from Ribo-Seq data. Users are now able to upload a custom reference transcriptome as well as data types other than Ribo-Seq/RNA-Seq. Incorporating custom data has been streamlined with RiboGalaxy (https://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie/) integration. The other new functionality is the rapid detection of translated open reading frames (ORFs) through a simple easy to use interface. The analysis of differential expression has been also improved via integration of DESeq2 and Anota2seq in addition to a number of other improvements of existing Trips-viz features.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33952332,SANCDB: an update on South African natural compounds and their readily available analogs.,"<h4>Background</h4>South African Natural Compounds Database (SANCDB; https://sancdb.rubi.ru.ac.za/ ) is the sole and a fully referenced database of natural chemical compounds of South African biodiversity. It is freely available, and since its inception in 2015, the database has become an important resource to several studies. Its content has been: used as training data for machine learning models; incorporated to larger databases; and utilized in drug discovery studies for hit identifications.<h4>Description</h4>Here, we report the updated version of SANCDB. The new version includes 412 additional compounds that have been reported since 2015, giving a total of 1012 compounds in the database. Further, although natural products (NPs) are an important source of unique scaffolds, they have a major drawback due to their complex structure resulting in low synthetic feasibility in the laboratory. With this in mind, SANCDB is, now, updated to provide direct links to commercially available analogs from two major chemical databases namely Mcule and MolPort. To our knowledge, this feature is not available in other NP databases. Additionally, for easier access to information by users, the database and website interface were updated. The compounds are now downloadable in many different chemical formats.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The drug discovery process relies heavily on NPs due to their unique chemical organization. This has inspired the establishment of numerous NP chemical databases. With the emergence of newer chemoinformatic technologies, existing chemical databases require constant updates to facilitate information accessibility and integration by users. Besides increasing the NPs compound content, the updated SANCDB allows users to access the individual compounds (if available) or their analogs from commercial databases seamlessly.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33959747,Updates to HCOP: the HGNC comparison of orthology predictions tool.,"Multiple resources currently exist that predict orthologous relationships between genes. These resources differ both in the methodologies used and in the species they make predictions for. The HGNC Comparison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP) search tool integrates and displays data from multiple ortholog prediction resources for a specified human gene or set of genes. An indication of the reliability of a prediction is provided by the number of resources that support it. HCOP was originally designed to show orthology predictions between human and mouse but has been expanded to include data from a current total of 20 selected vertebrate and model organism species. The HCOP pipeline used to fetch and integrate the information from the disparate ortholog and nomenclature data resources has recently been rewritten, both to enable the inclusion of new data and to take advantage of modern web technologies. Data from HCOP are used extensively in our work naming genes as the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (https://vertebrate.genenames.org).","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,software,data available

Characterizing their composition is, therefore, required for our understanding of cellular functions. Unfortunately, we lack knowledge of the comprehensive set of identities of protein complexes in human cells. To address this gap, we developed a machine learning framework to identify protein complexes in over 15,000 mass spectrometry experiments which resulted in the identification of nearly 7,000 physical assemblies. We show our resource, hu.MAP 2.0, is more accurate and comprehensive than previous state of the art high-throughput protein complex resources and gives rise to many new hypotheses, including for 274 completely uncharacterized proteins. Further, we identify 253 promiscuous proteins that participate in multiple complexes pointing to possible moonlighting roles. We have made hu.MAP 2.0 easily searchable in a web interface (http://humap2.proteincomplexes.org/), which will be a valuable resource for researchers across a broad range of interests including systems biology, structural biology, and molecular explanations of disease.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33984507,HisPhosSite: A comprehensive database of histidine phosphorylated proteins and sites.,"Histidine phosphorylation is critically important in a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is estimated to account for 6% of all phosphorylated amino acids. However, due to the acid lability of the PN bond, the study of pHis lags far behind that of pSer, pThr, and pTyr. Recently, the development and use of pHis-specific antibodies and methodologies have led to a resurgence in the study of histidine phosphorylation. Although a considerable number of pHis proteins and sites have been discovered, most of them have not been manually curated and integrated to any databases. There is a lack of a data repository for pHis, and such work is expected to help further systemic studies of pHis. Thus, we present a comprehensive resource database of histidine phosphorylation (HisPhosSite) by curating experimentally validated pHis proteins and sites and compiling putative pHis sites with ortholog search. HisPhosSite contains 776 verified pHis sites and 2702 verified pHis proteins in 38 eukaryotic and prokaryotic species and 15,378 putative pHis sites and 10,816 putative pHis proteins in 1366 species. HisPhosSite provides rich annotations of pHis sites and proteins and multiple search engines (including motif search and BLAST search) for users to locate pHis sites of interest. HisPhosSite is available at http://reprod.njmu.edu.cn/hisphossite. SIGNIFICANCE: Histidine phosphorylation is involved in a variety of cellular processes as well as cancers, and it has been proved to be more common than previously thought. The HisPhosSite database was developed to collect pHis data from published literatures with experimental evidences. Unification of the identified pHis proteins and sites will give researchers an informative resource for histidine phosphorylation. HisPhosSite has a user-friendly interface with multiple search engines for users to locate pHis sites of interest. In addition, the database provides rich structural and functional annotations. HisPhosSite will help future studies and elucidation of the functions of histidine phosphorylation.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33985427,TarDB: an online database for plant miRNA targets and miRNA-triggered phased siRNAs.,"<h4>Background</h4>In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal regulators of plant development and stress responses. Different computational tools and web servers have been developed for plant miRNA target prediction; however, in silico prediction normally contains false positive results. In addition, many plant miRNA target prediction servers lack information for miRNA-triggered phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). Creating a comprehensive and relatively high-confidence plant miRNA target database is much needed.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we report TarDB, an online database that collects three categories of relatively high-confidence plant miRNA targets: (i) cross-species conserved miRNA targets; (ii) degradome/PARE (Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends) sequencing supported miRNA targets; (iii) miRNA-triggered phasiRNA loci. TarDB provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to easily search, browse and retrieve miRNA targets and miRNA initiated phasiRNAs in a broad variety of plants. TarDB has a comprehensive collection of reliable plant miRNA targets containing previously unreported miRNA targets and miRNA-triggered phasiRNAs even in the well-studied model species. Most of these novel miRNA targets are relevant to lineage-specific or species-specific miRNAs. TarDB data is freely available at http://www.biosequencing.cn/TarDB .<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, TarDB serves as a useful web resource for exploring relatively high-confidence miRNA targets and miRNA-triggered phasiRNAs in plants.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Its whole genome sequence and deduced putative gene sequences are available. However, the functions of many pearl millet genes are unknown. Situations are similar for other crop species such as garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis), chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum). The objective of the data presented here was to improve functional annotations of genes of pearl millet, garden asparagus, chickpea and Tartary buckwheat with gene annotations of model plants, to systematically provide such annotations as well as their sequences on a website, and thereby to promote genomics for those crops.<h4>Data description</h4>Sequences of genomes and transcripts of pearl millet, garden asparagus, chickpea and Tartary buckwheat were downloaded from a public database. These transcripts were associated with functional annotations of their Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) counterparts identified by BLASTX.

33993461,TUPDB: Target-Unrelated Peptide Data Bank.,"The isolation of target-unrelated peptides (TUPs) through biopanning remains as a major problem of phage display selection experiments. These TUPs do not have any actual affinity toward targets of interest, which tend to be mistakenly identified as target-binding peptides. Therefore, an information portal for storing TUP data is urgently needed. Here, we present a TUP data bank (TUPDB), which is a comprehensive, manually curated database of approximately 73 experimentally verified TUPs and 1963 potential TUPs collected from TUPScan, the BDB database, and public research articles. The TUPScan tool has been integrated in TUPDB to facilitate TUP analysis. We believe that TUPDB can help identify and remove TUPs in future reports in the biopanning community. The database is of great importance to improving the quality of phage display-based epitope mapping and promoting the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics.

Data can be difficult to find despite existing online blood group resources and genetic and literature databases. We have developed a modern, elaborate database for D variants, thanks to an extensive literature search with meticulous curation of 387 peer-reviewed articles and 80 abstracts from major conferences and other sources. RHeference contains entries for 710 RHD alleles, 11 RHCE alleles, 30 phenotype descriptions (preventing data loss from historical sources), 35 partly characterized alleles, 3 haplotypes, and 16 miscellaneous entries. The entries include molecular, phenotypic, serological, alloimmunization, haplotype, geographical, and other data, detailed for each source. The main characteristics are summarized for each entry. The sources for all information are included and easily accessible through doi and PMID links. Overall, the database contains more than 10,000 individual pieces of data. We have set up the database architecture based on our previous expertise on database setup and biocuration for other topics, using modern technologies such as the Django framework, BioPython, Bootstrap, and Jquery. This architecture allows an easy access to data and enables simple and complex queries: combining multiple mutations, keywords, or any of the characteristics included in the database.

33995920,<i>ExVe</i>: The knowledge base of orthologous proteins identified in fungal extracellular vesicles.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are double-membrane particles associated with intercellular communication. Since the discovery of EV production in the fungus <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, the importance of EV release in its physiology and pathogenicity has been investigated. To date, few studies have investigated the proteomic content of EVs from multiple fungal species. Our main objective was to use an orthology approach to compare proteins identified by EV shotgun proteomics in 8 pathogenic and 1 nonpathogenic species. Using protein information from the UniProt and FungiDB databases, we integrated data for 11,433 hits in fungal EVs with an orthology perspective, resulting in 3,834 different orthologous groups. OG6_100083 (Hsp70 Pfam domain) was the unique orthologous group that was identified for all fungal species. Proteins with this protein domain are associated with the stress response, survival and morphological changes in different fungal species. Although no pathogenic orthologous group was found, we identified 5 orthologous groups exclusive to <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Using the criteria of at least 7 pathogenic fungi to define a cluster, we detected the 4 unique pathogenic orthologous groups. Taken together, our data suggest that Hsp70-related proteins might play a key role in fungal EVs, regardless of the pathogenic status. Using an orthology approach, we identified at least 4 protein domains that could be novel therapeutic targets against pathogenic fungi. Our results were compiled in the herein described ExVe database, which is publicly available at http://exve.icc.fiocruz.br.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
34010390,Integration of 1:1 orthology maps and updated datasets into Echinobase.,"Echinobase (https://echinobase.org) is a central online platform that generates, manages and hosts genomic data relevant to echinoderm research. While the resource primarily serves the echinoderm research community, the recent release of an excellent quality genome for the frequently studied purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome, v5.0) has provided an opportunity to adapt to the needs of a broader research community across other model systems. To this end, establishing pipelines to identify orthologous genes between echinoderms and other species has become a priority in many contexts including nomenclature, linking to data in other model organisms, and in internal functionality where data gathered in one hosted species can be associated with genes in other hosted echinoderms. This paper describes the orthology pipelines currently employed by Echinobase and how orthology data are processed to yield 1:1 ortholog mappings between a variety of echinoderms and other model taxa. We also describe functions of interest that have recently been included on the resource, including an updated developmental time course for S.purpuratus, and additional tracks for genome browsing. These data enhancements will increase the accessibility of the resource to non-echinoderm researchers and simultaneously expand the data quality and quantity available to core Echinobase users.

The KEA3 background database contains measured and predicted kinase-substrate interactions (KSI), kinase-protein interactions (KPI), and interactions supported by co-expression and co-occurrence data. To benchmark the performance of KEA3, we examined whether KEA3 can predict the perturbed kinase from single-kinase perturbation followed by gene expression experiments, and phosphoproteomics data collected from kinase-targeting small molecules.

The characteristics of eukaryotic replication origins are best understood in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For this species, origin prediction algorithms or web servers have been developed based on the sequence features of autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs). However, their performances are far from satisfactory. By utilizing the Z-curve methodology, we present a novel pipeline, Ori-Finder 3, for the computational prediction of replication origins in S. cerevisiae at the genome-wide level based solely on DNA sequences.

Recent years witnessed huge amount of sequencing data, revealing mutations responsible for drug resistance. However, the lack of an up-to-date repository remains a barrier towards utilization of these data and identifying major mutations-associated with resistance. Amongst all mutations, non-synonymous mutations alter the amino acid sequence of a protein and have a much greater effect on pathogenicity. Hence, this type of gene mutation is of prime interest of the present study. The purpose of this study is to develop an updated database comprising almost all reported substitutions within the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>) drug target genes <i>rpoB</i>, <i>inhA</i>, <i>katG</i>, <i>pncA</i>, <i>gyrA</i> and <i>gyrB.</i> Various bioinformatics prediction tools were used to assess the structural and biophysical impacts of the resistance causing non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) at the molecular level. This was followed by evaluating the impact of these mutations on binding affinity of the drugs to target proteins. We have developed a comprehensive online resource named MycoTRAP-DB (<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Resistance Associated Polymorphisms Database) that connects mutations in genes with their structural, functional and pathogenic implications on protein.

This integrated platform would enable comprehensive analysis and prioritization of SNPs for the development of improved diagnostics and antimycobacterial medications. Moreover, our study puts forward secondary mutations that can be important for prognostic assessments of drug-resistance mechanism and actionable anti-TB drugs.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
34029142,Landscape of GPCR expression along the mouse nephron.,"Kidney transport and other renal functions are regulated by multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed along the renal tubule. The rapid, recent appearance of comprehensive unbiased gene expression data in the various renal tubule segments, chiefly RNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry data, has provided a means of identifying patterns of GPCR expression along the renal tubule. To allow for comprehensive mapping, we first curated a comprehensive list of GPCRs in the genomes of mice, rats, and humans (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/GPCRs/) using multiple online data sources. We used this list to mine segment-specific and cell type-specific expression data from RNA-sequencing studies in microdissected mouse tubule segments to identify GPCRs that are selectively expressed in discrete tubule segments. Comparisons of these mapped mouse GPCRs with other omics datasets as well as functional data from isolated perfused tubule and micropuncture studies confirmed patterns of expression for well-known receptors and identified poorly studied GPCRs that are likely to play roles in the regulation of renal tubule function. Thus, we provide data resources for GPCR expression across the renal tubule, highlighting both well-known GPCRs and understudied receptors to provide guidance for future studies.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

At the same time, the scientific community needs a saliva-centered information platform that keeps pace with the rapid accumulation of new data and knowledge by annotating, refining, and updating the salivary proteome catalog. We developed the Human Salivary Proteome (HSP) Wiki as a public data platform for researching and retrieving custom-curated data and knowledge on the saliva proteome. The HSP Wiki is dynamically compiled and updated based on published saliva proteome studies and up-to-date protein reference records. It integrates a wide range of available information by funneling in data from established external protein, genome, transcriptome, and glycome databases. In addition, the HSP Wiki incorporates data from human disease-related studies. Users can explore the proteome of saliva simply by browsing the database, querying the available data, performing comparisons of data sets, and annotating existing protein entries using a simple, intuitive interface. The annotation process includes both user feedback and curator committee review to ensure the quality and validity of each entry. Here, we present the first overview of features and functions the HSP Wiki offers. As a saliva proteome-centric, publicly accessible database, the HSP Wiki will advance the knowledge of saliva composition and function in health and disease for users across a wide range of disciplines. As a community-based data- and knowledgebase, the HSP Wiki will serve as a worldwide platform to exchange salivary proteome information, inspire novel research ideas, and foster cross-discipline collaborations. The HSP Wiki will pave the way for harnessing the full potential of the salivary proteome for diagnosis, risk prediction, therapy of oral and systemic diseases, and preparedness for emerging infectious diseases.Database URL: https://salivaryproteome.nidcr.nih.gov/.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

34042771,Introducing a Platform for Integrating and Sharing Stem Cell Research Data.,"Advancements in regenerative medicine have highlighted the need for increased standardization and sharing of stem cell products to help drive these innovative interventions toward public availability and to increase collaboration in the scientific community. Although numerous attempts and numerous databases have been made to store this data, there is still a lack of a platform that incorporates heterogeneous stem cell information into a harmonized project-based framework. The aim of the platform described in this study, ReMeDy, is to provide an intelligent informatics solution which integrates diverse stem cell product characteristics with study subject and omics information. In the resulting platform, heterogeneous data is validated using predefined ontologies and stored in a relational database. In this initial feasibility study, testing of the ReMeDy functionality was performed using published, publically-available induced pluripotent stem cell projects conducted in in vitro, preclinical and intervention evaluations. It demonstrated the robustness of ReMeDy for storing diverse iPSC data, by seamlessly harmonizing diverse common data elements, and the potential utility of this platform for driving knowledge generation from the aggregation of this shared data. Next steps include increasing the number of curated projects by developing a crowdsourcing framework for data upload and an automated pipeline for metadata abstraction.

34046592,A map of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA structurome.,"SARS-CoV-2 has exploded throughout the human population. To facilitate efforts to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and to target the virus therapeutically, it is essential to have a roadmap of likely functional regions embedded in its RNA genome. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the <i>local</i> RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the highest likelihood of being functional. We recapitulate previously-known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a large reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Results are enhanced via the re-analyses of publicly-available genome-wide biochemical structure probing datasets that are broadly in agreement with our models. Additionally, ScanFold was updated to incorporate experimental data as constraints in the analysis to facilitate comparisons between ScanFold and other RNA modelling approaches. Ultimately, ScanFold was able to identify eight highly structured/conserved motifs in SARS-CoV-2 that agree with experimental data, without explicitly using these data. All results are made available via a public database (the RNAStructuromeDB: https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2) and model comparisons are readily viewable at https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2-global-model-comparisons.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Several exon-skipping ASOs have been approved to treat genetic diseases worldwide. However, a significant challenge is the difficulty in selecting an optimal sequence for exon skipping. The efficacy of ASOs is often unpredictable, because of the numerous factors involved in exon skipping. To address this gap, we have developed a computational method using machine-learning algorithms that factors in many parameters as well as experimental data to design highly effective ASOs for exon skipping. eSkip-Finder (https://eskip-finder.org) is the first web-based resource for helping researchers identify effective exon skipping ASOs. eSkip-Finder features two sections: (i) a predictor of the exon skipping efficacy of novel ASOs and (ii) a database of exon skipping ASOs. The predictor facilitates rapid analysis of a given set of exon/intron sequences and ASO lengths to identify effective ASOs for exon skipping based on a machine learning model trained by experimental data. We confirmed that predictions correlated well with in vitro skipping efficacy of sequences that were not included in the training data.

They are characterized by multiple inhibitory repeat domains, conserved disulfide bond pattern, and a tripeptide reactive center loop. These features of Pin-II type PIs make them potential molecules for protein engineering and designing inhibitors for agricultural and therapeutic applications. However, the diversity in these PIs remains unexplored due to the lack of annotated protein sequences and their functional attributes in the available databases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a database, PINIR (Pin-II type PIs Information Resource), by systematic collection and manual annotation of 415 Pin-II type PI protein sequences. For each PI, the number and position for signature sequences are specified: 695 domains, 75 linkers, 63 reactive center loops, and 10 disulfide bond patterns are identified and mapped. Database analysis revealed novel subcategories of PIs, species-correlated occurrence of inhibitory domains, reactive center loops, and disulfide bond patterns. By analyzing linker regions, we predict that alternative processing at linker regions could generate PI variants in the Solanaceae family.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PINIR ( https://pinir.ncl.res.in ) provides a web interface for browsing and analyzing the protein sequences of Pin-II type PIs. Information about signature sequences, spatio-temporal expression, biochemical properties, gene sequences, and literature references are provided. Analysis of PINIR depicts conserved species-specific features of Pin-II type PI protein sequences.

Herein, we report CanVaS, a Cancer Variation reSource aiming to document the genetic variation of cancer patients in Greece. CanVaS comprises germline genetic data from 7,363 Greek individuals with a personal and/or family history of malignancy. The data set incorporates approximately 24,000 functionally annotated rare variants in 97 established or suspected cancer susceptibility genes. For each variant, allele frequency for the Greek population, interpretation for clinical significance, anonymized family and segregation information, as well as phenotypic traits of the carriers, are included. Moreover, information on the geographic distribution of the variants across the country is provided, enabling the study of Greek population isolates. Direct comparisons between Greek (sub)populations with relevant genetic resources are supported, allowing fine-grain localized adjustment of guidelines and clinical decision-making. Most importantly, anonymized data are available for download, while the Leiden Open Variation Database schema is adopted, enabling integration/interconnection with central resources. CanVaS could become a stepping-stone for a countrywide effort to characterize the cancer genetic variation landscape, concurrently supporting national and international cancer research.

34174819,UniBind: maps of high-confidence direct TF-DNA interactions across nine species.,"<h4>Background</h4>Transcription factors (TFs) bind specifically to TF binding sites (TFBSs) at cis-regulatory regions to control transcription. It is critical to locate these TF-DNA interactions to understand transcriptional regulation. Efforts to predict bona fide TFBSs benefit from the availability of experimental data mapping DNA binding regions of TFs (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing - ChIP-seq).<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we processed ~‚Äâ10,000 public ChIP-seq datasets from nine species to provide high-quality TFBS predictions. After quality control, it culminated with the prediction of ~‚Äâ56 million TFBSs with experimental and computational support for direct TF-DNA interactions for 644 TFs in >‚Äâ1000 cell lines and tissues. These TFBSs were used to predict >‚Äâ197,000 cis-regulatory modules representing clusters of binding events in the corresponding genomes. The high-quality of the TFBSs was reinforced by their evolutionary conservation, enrichment at active cis-regulatory regions, and capacity to predict combinatorial binding of TFs. Further, we confirmed that the cell type and tissue specificity of enhancer activity was correlated with the number of TFs with binding sites predicted in these regions. All the data is provided to the community through the UniBind database that can be accessed through its web-interface ( https://unibind.uio.no/ ), a dedicated RESTful API, and as genomic tracks. Finally, we provide an enrichment tool, available as a web-service and an R package, for users to find TFs with enriched TFBSs in a set of provided genomic regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>UniBind is the first resource of its kind, providing the largest collection of high-confidence direct TF-DNA interactions in nine species.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

34214659,An inferred functional impact map of genetic variants in rice.,"Interpreting the functional impacts of genetic variants (GVs) is an important challenge for functional genomic studies in crops and next-generation breeding. Currently, studies in rice (Oryza sativa) have mainly focused on the identification of GVs, while the functional annotation of GVs has not yet been systematically carried out. Here we present a functional impact map of GVs in rice. We curated haplotype information of 17,397,026 GVs from sequencing data of 4,726 rice accessions. We quantitatively evaluated the effects of missense mutations in coding regions in each haplotype based on the conservation of amino acid residues and obtained the effects of 918,848 non-redundant missense GVs. We also generated high-quality chromatin accessibility (CA) data from six representative rice tissues and used these data to train deep convolutional neural network models to predict the impacts of 5,067,405 GVs for CA in regulatory regions. We characterized the functional properties and tissue specificity of the effects of GVs and found that large-effect GVs in coding and regulatory regions might be subject to selection in different directions. We finally demonstrated how the functional impact map could be used to prioritize the causal variants in mapping populations. This impact map will be a useful resource for accelerating gene cloning and functional studies in rice and can be freely queried in RiceVarMap V2.0 (http://ricevarmap.ncpgr.cn).","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

34225788,A global overview of genetically interpretable multimorbidities among common diseases in the UK Biobank.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multimorbidities greatly increase the global health burdens, but the landscapes of their genetic risks have not been systematically investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>We used the hospital inpatient data of 385,335 patients in the UK Biobank to investigate the multimorbid relations among 439 common diseases. Post-GWAS analyses were performed to identify multimorbidity shared genetic risks at the genomic loci, network, as well as overall genetic architecture levels. We conducted network decomposition for the networks of genetically interpretable multimorbidities to detect the hub diseases and the involved molecules and functions in each module.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 11,285 multimorbidities among 439 common diseases were identified, and 46% of them were genetically interpretable at the loci, network, or overall genetic architecture levels. Multimorbidities affecting the same and different physiological systems displayed different patterns of the shared genetic components, with the former more likely to share loci-level genetic components while the latter more likely to share network-level genetic components. Moreover, both the loci- and network-level genetic components shared by multimorbidities converged on cell immunity, protein metabolism, and gene silencing. Furthermore, we found that the genetically interpretable multimorbidities tend to form network modules, mediated by hub diseases and featuring physiological categories. Finally, we showcased how hub diseases mediating the multimorbidity modules could help provide useful insights for the genetic contributors of multimorbidities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results provide a systematic resource for understanding the genetic predispositions of multimorbidities and indicate that hub diseases and converged molecules and functions may be the key for treating multimorbidities. We have created an online database that facilitates researchers and physicians to browse, search, or download these multimorbidities ( https://multimorbidity.comp-sysbio.org ).","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
34013642,Efficient study design to estimate population means with multiple measurement instruments.,"Outcomes from studies assessing exposure often use multiple measurements. In previous work, using a model first proposed by Buonoccorsi (1991), we showed that combining direct (eg, biomarkers) and indirect (eg, self-report) measurements provides a more accurate picture of true exposure than estimates obtained when using a single type of measurement. In this article, we propose a tool for efficient design of studies that include both direct and indirect measurements of a relevant outcome. Based on data from a pilot or preliminary study, the tool, which is available online as a shiny app at https://michalbitan.shinyapps.io/shinyApp/, can be used to compute: (1) the sample size required for a statistical power analysis, while optimizing the percent of participants who should provide direct measures of exposure (biomarkers) in addition to the indirect (self-report) measures provided by all participants; (2) the ideal number of replicates; and (3) the allocation of resources to intervention and control arms. In addition we show how to examine the sensitivity of results to underlying assumptions. We illustrate our analysis using studies of tobacco smoke exposure and nutrition. In these examples, a near-optimal allocation of the resources can be found even if the assumptions are not precise.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,
34015821,ProtCHOIR: a tool for proteome-scale generation of homo-oligomers.,"The rapid developments in gene sequencing technologies achieved in the recent decades, along with the expansion of knowledge on the three-dimensional structures of proteins, have enabled the construction of proteome-scale databases of protein models such as the Genome3D and ModBase. Nevertheless, although gene products are usually expressed as individual polypeptide chains, most biological processes are associated with either transient or stable oligomerisation. In the PDB databank, for example, ~40% of the deposited structures contain at least one homo-oligomeric interface. Unfortunately, databases of protein models are generally devoid of multimeric structures. To tackle this particular issue, we have developed ProtCHOIR, a tool that is able to generate homo-oligomeric structures in an automated fashion, providing detailed information for the input protein and output complex. ProtCHOIR requires input of either a sequence or a protomeric structure that is queried against a pre-constructed local database of homo-oligomeric structures, then extensively analyzed using well-established tools such as PSI-Blast, MAFFT, PISA and Molprobity. Finally, MODELLER is employed to achieve the construction of the homo-oligomers. The output complex is thoroughly analyzed taking into account its stereochemical quality, interfacial stabilities, hydrophobicity and conservation profile. All these data are then summarized in a user-friendly HTML report that can be saved or printed as a PDF file. The software is easily parallelizable and also outputs a comma-separated file with summary statistics that can straightforwardly be concatenated as a spreadsheet-like document for large-scale data analyses. As a proof-of-concept, we built oligomeric models for the Mabellini Mycobacterium abscessus structural proteome database. ProtCHOIR can be run as a web-service and the code can be obtained free-of-charge at http://lmdm.biof.ufrj.br/protchoir.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,software,submit job

A stringent examination of the 7848 proteins indicates that close to 89% of the proteins have occurrence of at least a network of 2p or a higher p-p network. The occurrence of p-p networks in various protein superfamilies based on SCOP, CATH and EC classifiers has also been probed in the present work. In general, we find that multidomain and membrane proteins as well as lyases show a more number of these networks. Analysis of the distribution of angle between planes of two proximal aromatic rings (<U+03D5>) distribution indicates that at a larger cutoff distance (between centroid of two aromatic rings), above 5, C-H<U+22EF>p interactions (T-shaped orientation) are more prevalent, while p-p interactions (stacked orientation) are more prevalent at a smaller cutoff distance. The connectivity patterns of p-p networks propose strong propensity of finding arrangement of aromatic residues as clusters rather than linear arrangement. We have also made a public domain database """"Aromatic-Aromatic Interactions Database"""" (A(2)ID) comprising of all types of p-p networks and their connectivity pattern present in proteins.

The sc-PDB provides a functional annotation for proteins, a chemical description for ligands and the detailed intermolecular interactions for complexes. The sc-PDB now includes a hierarchical classification of all the binding sites within a functional class.<h4>Method</h4>The sc-PDB entries were first clustered according to the protein name indifferent of the species. For each cluster, we identified dissimilar sites (e.g. catalytic and allosteric sites of an enzyme). SCOPE AND APPLICATIONS: The classification of sc-PDB targets by binding site diversity was intended to facilitate chemogenomics approaches to drug design. In ligand-based approaches, it avoids comparing ligands that do not share the same binding site. In structure-based approaches, it permits to quantitatively evaluate the diversity of the binding site definition (variations in size, sequence and/or structure).<h4>Availability</h4>The sc-PDB database is freely available at: http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/scPDB.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

The identification of suitable biomarkers could facilitate early detection and diagnosis and allow better understanding of the underlying pathology. One of the challenges in meeting this goal is the necessary integration of experimental results from multiple biological levels for further analysis by data mining. Data integration in the life science is still a struggle, and many groups are looking to the benefits promised by the Semantic Web for data integration.<h4>Results</h4>We present a Semantic Web approach to developing a knowledge base that integrates data from high-throughput experiments on kidney and urine. A specialised KUP ontology is used to tie the various layers together, whilst background knowledge from external databases is incorporated by conversion into RDF. Using SPARQL as a query mechanism, we are able to query for proteins expressed in urine and place these back into the context of genes expressed in regions of the kidney.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The KUPKB gives KUP biologists the means to ask queries across many resources in order to aggregate knowledge that is necessary for answering biological questions. The Semantic Web technologies we use, together with the background knowledge from the domain's ontologies, allows both rapid conversion and integration of this knowledge base.

While many neuropeptides have been identified in previous studies, the resulting data has not been structured to facilitate further analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the main technology for high-throughput neuropeptide identification. Many neuropeptides are difficult to identify when searching MS/MS spectra against large protein databases because of their atypical lengths (e.g. shorter/longer than common tryptic peptides) and lack of tryptic residues to facilitate peptide ionization/fragmentation. NeuroPedia is a neuropeptide encyclopedia of peptide sequences (including genomic and taxonomic information) and spectral libraries of identified MS/MS spectra of homolog neuropeptides from multiple species. Searching neuropeptide MS/MS data against known NeuroPedia sequences will improve the sensitivity of database search tools. Moreover, the availability of neuropeptide spectral libraries will also enable the utilization of spectral library search tools, which are known to further improve the sensitivity of peptide identification. These will also reinforce the confidence in peptide identifications by enabling visual comparisons between new and previously identified neuropeptide MS/MS spectra.<h4>Availability</h4>http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/NeuroPedia.html<h4>Contact</h4>bandeira@ucsd.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

22139934,Cube-DB: detection of functional divergence in human protein families.,"Cube-DB is a database of pre-evaluated results for detection of functional divergence in human/vertebrate protein families. The analysis is organized around the nomenclature associated with the human proteins, but based on all currently available vertebrate genomes. Using full genomes enables us, through a mutual-best-hit strategy, to construct comparable taxonomical samples for all paralogues under consideration. Functional specialization is scored on the residue level according to two models of behavior after divergence: heterotachy and homotachy. In the first case, the positions on the protein sequence are scored highly if they are conserved in the reference group of orthologs, and overlap poorly with the residue type choice in the paralogs groups (such positions will also be termed functional determinants). The second model additionally requires conservation within each group of paralogs (functional discriminants). The scoring functions are phylogeny independent, but sensitive to the residue type similarity. The results are presented as a table of per-residue scores, and mapped onto related structure (when available) via browser-embedded visualization tool. They can also be downloaded as a spreadsheet table, and sessions for two additional molecular visualization tools.

22276777,miRdSNP: a database of disease-associated SNPs and microRNA target sites on 3'UTRs of human genes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can lead to the susceptibility and onset of diseases through their effects on gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Recent findings indicate that SNPs could create, destroy, or modify the efficiency of miRNA binding to the 3'UTR of a gene, resulting in gene dysregulation. With the rapidly growing number of published disease-associated SNPs (dSNPs), there is a strong need for resources specifically recording dSNPs on the 3'UTRs and their nucleotide distance from miRNA target sites. We present here miRdSNP, a database incorporating three important areas of dSNPs, miRNA target sites, and diseases.<h4>Description</h4>miRdSNP provides a unique database of dSNPs on the 3'UTRs of human genes manually curated from PubMed. The current release includes 786 dSNP-disease associations for 630 unique dSNPs and 204 disease types. miRdSNP annotates genes with experimentally confirmed targeting by miRNAs and indexes miRNA target sites predicted by TargetScan and PicTar as well as potential miRNA target sites newly generated by dSNPs. A robust web interface and search tools are provided for studying the proximity of miRNA binding sites to dSNPs in relation to human diseases. Searches can be dynamically filtered by gene name, miRBase ID, target prediction algorithm, disease, and any nucleotide distance between dSNPs and miRNA target sites. Results can be viewed at the sequence level showing the annotated locations for miRNA target sites and dSNPs on the entire 3'UTR sequences. The integration of dSNPs with the UCSC Genome browser is also supported.<h4>Conclusion</h4>miRdSNP provides a comprehensive data source of dSNPs and robust tools for exploring their distance from miRNA target sites on the 3'UTRs of human genes. miRdSNP enables researchers to further explore the molecular mechanism of gene dysregulation for dSNPs at posttranscriptional level. miRdSNP is freely available on the web at http://mirdsnp.ccr.buffalo.edu.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
22334387,The androgen receptor gene mutations database: 2012 update.,"The current version of the androgen receptor gene (AR) mutations database is described. A major change to the database is that the nomenclature and numbering scheme now conforms to all Human Genome Variation Society norms. The total number of reported mutations has risen from 605 to 1,029 since 2004. The database now contains a number of mutations that are associated with prostate cancer (CaP) treatment regimens, while the number of AR mutations found in CaP tissues has more than doubled from 76 to 159. In addition, in a number of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and CaP cases, multiple mutations have been found within the same tissue samples. For the first time, we report on a disconnect within the AIS phenotype-genotype relationship among our own patient database, in that over 40% of our patients with a classic complete AIS or partial AIS phenotypes did not appear to have a mutation in their AR gene. The implications of this phenomenon on future locus-specific mutation database (LSDB) development are discussed, together with the concept that mutations can be associated with both loss- and gain-of-function, and the effect of multiple AR mutations within individuals. The database is available on the internet (http://androgendb.mcgill.ca), and a web-based LSDB with the variants using the Leiden Open Variation Database platform is available at http://www.lovd.nl/AR.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
22345505,ANAP: an integrated knowledge base for Arabidopsis protein interaction network analysis.,"Protein interactions are fundamental to the molecular processes occurring within an organism and can be utilized in network biology to help organize, simplify, and understand biological complexity. Currently, there are more than 10 publicly available Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein interaction databases. However, there are limitations with these databases, including different types of interaction evidence, a lack of defined standards for protein identifiers, differing levels of information, and, critically, a lack of integration between them. In this paper, we present an interactive bioinformatics Web tool, ANAP (Arabidopsis Network Analysis Pipeline), which serves to effectively integrate the different data sets and maximize access to available data. ANAP has been developed for Arabidopsis protein interaction integration and network-based study to facilitate functional protein network analysis. ANAP integrates 11 Arabidopsis protein interaction databases, comprising 201,699 unique protein interaction pairs, 15,208 identifiers (including 11,931 The Arabidopsis Information Resource Arabidopsis Genome Initiative codes), 89 interaction detection methods, 73 species that interact with Arabidopsis, and 6,161 references. ANAP can be used as a knowledge base for constructing protein interaction networks based on user input and supports both direct and indirect interaction analysis. It has an intuitive graphical interface allowing easy network visualization and provides extensive detailed evidence for each interaction. In addition, ANAP displays the gene and protein annotation in the generated interactive network with links to The Arabidopsis Information Resource, the AtGenExpress Visualization Tool, the Arabidopsis 1,001 Genomes GBrowse, the Protein Knowledgebase, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and the Ensembl Genome Browser to significantly aid functional network analysis.

22369658,DetoxiProt: an integrated database for detoxification proteins.,"<h4>Background</h4>Detoxification proteins are a class of proteins for degradation and/or elimination of endogenous and exogenous toxins or medicines, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by these materials. Most of these proteins are generated as a response to the stimulation of toxins or medicines. They are essential for the clearance of harmful substances and for maintenance of physiological balance in organisms. Thus, it is important to collect and integrate information on detoxification proteins.<h4>Results</h4>To store, retrieve and analyze the information related to their features and functions, we developed the DetoxiProt, a comprehensive database for annotation of these proteins. This database provides detailed introductions about different classes of the detoxification proteins. Extensive annotations of these proteins, including sequences, structures, features, inducers, inhibitors, substrates, chromosomal location, functional domains as well as physiological-biochemical properties were generated. Furthermore, pre-computed BLAST results, multiple sequence alignments and evolutionary trees for detoxification proteins are also provided for evolutionary study of conserved function and pathways. The current version of DetoxiProt contains 5956 protein entries distributed in 628 organisms. An easy to use web interface was designed, so that annotations about each detoxification protein can be retrieved by browsing with a specific method or by searching with different criteria.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DetoxiProt provides an effective and efficient way of accessing the detoxification protein sequences and other high-quality information. This database would be a valuable source for toxicologists, pharmacologists and medicinal chemists.

This resource will provide information to researchers studying the molecular and genetic causes of stroke in terms of genomic variants, genes, and pathways.<h4>Methods</h4>Reported genetic variants, gene structure, phenotypes, and literature information regarding stroke were collected and extracted from publicly available databases describing variants, genome, proteome, functional annotation, and disease subtypes. Stroke related candidate pathways and etiologic genes that participate significantly in risk were analyzed in terms of canonical pathways in public biological pathway databases. These efforts resulted in a relational database of genetic signals of cerebral stroke, SigCS base, which implements an effective web retrieval system.<h4>Results</h4>The current version of SigCS base documents 1943 non-redundant genes with 11472 genetic variants and 165 non-redundant pathways. The web retrieval system of SigCS base consists of two principal search flows, including: 1) a gene-based variant search using gene table browsing or a keyword search, and, 2) a pathway-based variant search using pathway table browsing. SigCS base is freely accessible at http://sysbio.kribb.re.kr/sigcs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SigCS base is an effective tool that can assist researchers in the identification of the genetic factors associated with stroke by utilizing existing literature information, selecting candidate genes and variants for experimental studies, and examining the pathways that contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
22836712,A comparative cellular and molecular biology of longevity database.,"Discovering key cellular and molecular traits that promote longevity is a major goal of aging and longevity research. One experimental strategy is to determine which traits have been selected during the evolution of longevity in naturally long-lived animal species. This comparative approach has been applied to lifespan research for nearly four decades, yielding hundreds of datasets describing aspects of cell and molecular biology hypothesized to relate to animal longevity. Here, we introduce a Comparative Cellular and Molecular Biology of Longevity Database, available at ( http://genomics.brocku.ca/ccmbl/ ), as a compendium of comparative cell and molecular data presented in the context of longevity. This open access database will facilitate the meta-analysis of amalgamated datasets using standardized maximum lifespan (MLSP) data (from AnAge). The first edition contains over 800 data records describing experimental measurements of cellular stress resistance, reactive oxygen species metabolism, membrane composition, protein homeostasis, and genome homeostasis as they relate to vertebrate species MLSP.

22912585,Dissecting the gene network of dietary restriction to identify evolutionarily conserved pathways and new functional genes.,"Dietary restriction (DR), limiting nutrient intake from diet without causing malnutrition, delays the aging process and extends lifespan in multiple organisms. The conserved life-extending effect of DR suggests the involvement of fundamental mechanisms, although these remain a subject of debate. To help decipher the life-extending mechanisms of DR, we first compiled a list of genes that if genetically altered disrupt or prevent the life-extending effects of DR. We called these DR-essential genes and identified more than 100 in model organisms such as yeast, worms, flies, and mice. In order for other researchers to benefit from this first curated list of genes essential for DR, we established an online database called GenDR (http://genomics.senescence.info/diet/). To dissect the interactions of DR-essential genes and discover the underlying lifespan-extending mechanisms, we then used a variety of network and systems biology approaches to analyze the gene network of DR. We show that DR-essential genes are more conserved at the molecular level and have more molecular interactions than expected by chance. Furthermore, we employed a guilt-by-association method to predict novel DR-essential genes. In budding yeast, we predicted nine genes related to vacuolar functions; we show experimentally that mutations deleting eight of those genes prevent the life-extending effects of DR. Three of these mutants (OPT2, FRE6, and RCR2) had extended lifespan under ad libitum, indicating that the lack of further longevity under DR is not caused by a general compromise of fitness. These results demonstrate how network analyses of DR using GenDR can be used to make phenotypically relevant predictions. Moreover, gene-regulatory circuits reveal that the DR-induced transcriptional signature in yeast involves nutrient-sensing, stress responses and meiotic transcription factors. Finally, comparing the influence of gene expression changes during DR on the interactomes of multiple organisms led us to suggest that DR commonly suppresses translation, while stimulating an ancient reproduction-related process.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,tentative 1; Cannot be contributed to,

Chromosome replication begins at specific sites, called origins of replication (oriCs), for all three domains of life. However, the origins of replication still remain unknown in a considerably large number of bacterial and archaeal genomes completely sequenced so far. The availability of increasing complete bacterial and archaeal genomes has created challenges and opportunities for identification of their oriCs in silico, as well as in vivo. Based on the Z-curve theory, we have developed a web-based system Ori-Finder to predict oriCs in bacterial genomes with high accuracy and reliability by taking advantage of comparative genomics, and the predicted oriC regions have been organized into an online database DoriC, which is publicly available at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/ since 2007. Five years after we constructed DoriC, the database has significant advances over the number of bacterial genomes, increasing about 4-fold. Additionally, oriC regions in archaeal genomes identified by in vivo experiments, as well as in silico analyses, have also been added to the database. Consequently, the latest release of DoriC contains oriCs for >1500 bacterial genomes and 81 archaeal genomes, respectively.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

The visual representation of the annotations provided by APPRIS for each gene allows annotators and researchers alike to easily identify functional changes brought about by splicing events. In addition to collecting, integrating and analyzing reliable predictions of the effect of splicing events, APPRIS also selects a single reference sequence for each gene, here termed the principal isoform, based on the annotations of structure, function and conservation for each transcript. APPRIS identifies a principal isoform for 85% of the protein-coding genes in the GENCODE 7 release for ENSEMBL.

23180799,PGDD: a database of gene and genome duplication in plants.,"Genome duplication (GD) has permanently shaped the architecture and function of many higher eukaryotic genomes. The angiosperms (flowering plants) are outstanding models in which to elucidate consequences of GD for higher eukaryotes, owing to their propensity for chromosomal duplication or even triplication in a few cases. Duplicated genome structures often require both intra- and inter-genome alignments to unravel their evolutionary history, also providing the means to deduce both obvious and otherwise-cryptic orthology, paralogy and other relationships among genes. The burgeoning sets of angiosperm genome sequences provide the foundation for a host of investigations into the functional and evolutionary consequences of gene and GD. To provide genome alignments from a single resource based on uniform standards that have been validated by empirical studies, we built the Plant Genome Duplication Database (PGDD; freely available at http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/), a web service providing synteny information in terms of colinearity between chromosomes.

23209799,The duplicated genes database: identification and functional annotation of co-localised duplicated genes across genomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>There has been a surge in studies linking genome structure and gene expression, with special focus on duplicated genes. Although initially duplicated from the same sequence, duplicated genes can diverge strongly over evolution and take on different functions or regulated expression. However, information on the function and expression of duplicated genes remains sparse. Identifying groups of duplicated genes in different genomes and characterizing their expression and function would therefore be of great interest to the research community. The 'Duplicated Genes Database' (DGD) was developed for this purpose.<h4>Methodology</h4>Nine species were included in the DGD. For each species, BLAST analyses were conducted on peptide sequences corresponding to the genes mapped on a same chromosome. Groups of duplicated genes were defined based on these pairwise BLAST comparisons and the genomic location of the genes. For each group, Pearson correlations between gene expression data and semantic similarities between functional GO annotations were also computed when the relevant information was available.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Duplicated Gene Database provides a list of co-localised and duplicated genes for several species with the available gene co-expression level and semantic similarity value of functional annotation. Adding these data to the groups of duplicated genes provides biological information that can prove useful to gene expression analyses. The Duplicated Gene Database can be freely accessed through the DGD website at http://dgd.genouest.org.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Currently, there are 837, 835 and 821 candidate genes recorded in T-HOD for hypertension, obesity and diabetes, respectively. T-HOD employed the state-of-art text-mining technologies, including a gene/disease identification system and a disease-gene relation extraction system, which can be used to affirm the association of genes with three diseases and provide more evidence for further studies. The primary inputs of T-HOD are the three kinds of diseases, and the output is a list of disease-related genes that can be ranked based on their number of appearance, protein-protein interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Unlike manually constructed disease gene databases, the content of T-HOD is regularly updated by our text-mining system and verified by domain experts. The interface of T-HOD facilitates easy browsing for users and allows T-HOD curators to verify data efficiently.

In proteomics, several studies aim to use protein sequence repositories to annotate MS experiments or to detect differentially expressed proteins. However, the available protein sequence repositories are not designed to fully detect protein isoforms derived from mRNA splice variants. To foster knowledge for the field, here we introduce SpliceProt, a new protein sequence repository of transcriptome experimental data used to investigate for putative splice variants in human proteomes. Current version of SpliceProt contains 159719 non-redundant putative polypeptide sequences. The assessment of the potential of SpliceProt in detecting new protein isoforms resulting from alternative splicing was performed by using publicly available proteomics data. We detected 173 peptides hypothetically derived from splice variants, which 54 of them are not present in UniprotKB/TrEMBL sequence repository. In comparison to other protein sequence repositories, SpliceProt contains a greater number of unique peptides and is able to detect more splice variants. Therefore, SpliceProt provides a solution for the annotation of proteomics experiments regarding splice isofoms.

OncomiRs are microRNAs (miRNAs) that have been frequently shown to be deregulated in cancer. However, although several oncomiRs have been identified and characterized, there is as yet no comprehensive compilation of this data which has rendered it underutilized by cancer biologists. There is therefore an unmet need in generating bioinformatic platforms to speed the identification of novel therapeutic targets.<h4>Description</h4>We describe here OncomiRdbB, a comprehensive database of oncomiRs mined from different existing databases for mouse and humans along with novel oncomiRs that we have validated in human breast cancer samples. The database also lists their respective predicted targets, identified using miRanda, along with their IDs, sequences, chromosome location and detailed description. This database facilitates querying by search strings including microRNA name, sequence, accession number, target genes and organisms. The microRNA networks and their hubs with respective targets at 3'UTR, 5'UTR and exons of different pathway genes were also deciphered using the 'R' algorithm.<h4>Conclusion</h4>OncomiRdbB is a comprehensive and integrated database of oncomiRs and their targets in breast cancer with multiple query options which will help enhance both understanding of the biology of breast cancer and the development of new and innovative microRNA based diagnostic tools and targets of therapeutic significance.

Gene mutations of transporters are often related to pharmacogenetics traits. Recent developments in high throughput technologies on genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics allow in depth studies of transporter genes in normal cellular processes and diverse disease conditions. The flood of high throughput data have resulted in urgent need for an updated knowledgebase with curated, organized, and annotated human transporters in an easily accessible way. Using a pipeline with the combination of automated keywords query, sequence similarity search and manual curation on transporters, we collected 1,555 human non-redundant transporter genes to develop the Human Transporter Database (HTD) (http://htd.cbi.pku.edu.cn). Based on the extensive annotations, global properties of the transporter genes were illustrated, such as expression patterns and polymorphisms in relationships with their ligands. We noted that the human transporters were enriched in many fundamental biological processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and cardiac muscle contraction, and significantly associated with Mendelian and complex diseases such as epilepsy and sudden infant death syndrome. Overall, HTD provides a well-organized interface to facilitate research communities to search detailed molecular and genetic information of transporters for development of personalized medicine.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Increasing the relative oil concentration in soybean seeds is many researchers' goal, but a complete analysis platform of functional annotation for the genes involved in the soybean acyl-lipid pathway is still lacking. Following the success of soybean whole-genome sequencing, functional annotation has become a major challenge for the scientific community. Whole-genome transcriptome analysis is a powerful way to predict genes with biological functions. It is essential to build a comprehensive analysis platform for integrating soybean whole-genome sequencing data, the available transcriptome data and protein information. This platform could also be used to identify acyl-lipid metabolism pathways.<h4>Description</h4>In this study, we describe our construction of the Soybean Functional Genomics Database (SFGD) using Generic Genome Browser (Gbrowse) as the core platform. We integrated microarray expression profiling with 255 samples from 14 groups' experiments and mRNA-seq data with 30 samples from four groups' experiments, including spatial and temporal transcriptome data for different soybean development stages and environmental stresses. The SFGD includes a gene co-expression regulatory network containing 23,267 genes and 1873 miRNA-target pairs, and a group of acyl-lipid pathways containing 221 enzymes and more than 1550 genes. The SFGD also provides some key analysis tools, i.e. BLAST search, expression pattern search and cis-element significance analysis, as well as gene ontology information search and single nucleotide polymorphism display.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The SFGD is a comprehensive database integrating genome and transcriptome data, and also for soybean acyl-lipid metabolism pathways. It provides useful toolboxes for biologists to improve the accuracy and robustness of soybean functional genomics analysis, further improving understanding of gene regulatory networks for effective crop improvement.

Several lines of evidence suggest that epigenetic- or genetic-mediated dysfunction is frequently present in these disorders. To date, the inheritance patterns have been complicated by the problem of integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic factors that have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, there is a need to build a comprehensive database for storing epigenomic and transcriptomic data relating to psychiatric disorders.<h4>Description</h4>We have developed the PD_NGSAtlas, which focuses on the efficient storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data based on next-generation sequencing and on the quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders. The current release of the PD_NGSAtlas contains 43 DNA methylation profiles and 37 transcription profiles detected by MeDIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, respectively, in two distinct brain regions and peripheral blood of SZ, BP and non-psychiatric controls. In addition to these data that were generated in-house, we have included, and will continue to include, published DNA methylation and gene expression data from other research groups, with a focus on psychiatric disorders. A flexible query engine has been developed for the acquisition of methylation profiles and transcription profiles for special genes or genomic regions of interest of the selected samples. Furthermore, the PD_NGSAtlas offers online tools for identifying aberrantly methylated and expressed events involved in psychiatric disorders. A genome browser has been developed to provide integrative and detailed views of multidimensional data in a given genomic context, which can help researchers understand molecular mechanisms from epigenetic and transcriptional perspectives. Moreover, users can download the methylation and transcription data for further analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The PD_NGSAtlas aims to provide storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data as well as quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders.

Although the body of published works is remarkable for a small nation, the faunistic data has remained too scattered for a thorough understanding of regional biotic diversity, for comparative and ecological research, and for informed conservation purposes. A national checklist is long overdue. Here, a critical review of all published records in any language is provided. The species list currently comprises 738 species, is published online at http://www.bioportal.si/katalog/araneae.php under the title Araneae Sloveniae, and will be updated in due course.

25922515,The Fossil Calibration Database-A New Resource for Divergence Dating.,"Fossils provide the principal basis for temporal calibrations, which are critical to the accuracy of divergence dating analyses. Translating fossil data into minimum and maximum bounds for calibrations is the most important-often least appreciated-step of divergence dating. Properly justified calibrations require the synthesis of phylogenetic, paleontological, and geological evidence and can be difficult for nonspecialists to formulate. The dynamic nature of the fossil record (e.g., new discoveries, taxonomic revisions, updates of global or local stratigraphy) requires that calibration data be updated continually lest they become obsolete. Here, we announce the Fossil Calibration Database (http://fossilcalibrations.org), a new open-access resource providing vetted fossil calibrations to the scientific community. Calibrations accessioned into this database are based on individual fossil specimens and follow best practices for phylogenetic justification and geochronological constraint. The associated Fossil Calibration Series, a calibration-themed publication series at Palaeontologia Electronica, will serve as a key pipeline for peer-reviewed calibrations to enter the database.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
26061870,Human Chromosome Y and Haplogroups; introducing YDHS Database.,"<h4>Background</h4>As the high throughput sequencing efforts generate more biological information, scientists from different disciplines are interpreting the polymorphisms that make us unique. In addition, there is an increasing trend in general public to research their own genealogy, find distant relatives and to know more about their biological background. Commercial vendors are providing analyses of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal markers for such purposes. Clearly, an easy-to-use free interface to the existing data on the identified variants would be in the interest of general public and professionals less familiar with the field. Here we introduce a novel metadatabase YDHS that aims to provide such an interface for Y-chromosomal DNA (Y-DNA) haplogroups and sequence variants.<h4>Methods</h4>The database uses ISOGG Y-DNA tree as the source of mutations and haplogroups and by using genomic positions of the mutations the database links them to genes and other biological entities. YDHS contains analysis tools for deeper Y-SNP analysis.<h4>Results</h4>YDHS addresses the shortage of Y-DNA related databases. We have tested our database using a set of different cases from literature ranging from infertility to autism. The database is at http://www.semanticgen.net/ydhs<h4>Conclusions</h4>Y-chromosomal DNA (Y-DNA) haplogroups and sequence variants have not been in the scientific limelight, excluding certain specialized fields like forensics, mainly because there is not much freely available information or it is scattered in different sources. However, as we have demonstrated Y-SNPs do play a role in various cases on the haplogroup level and it is possible to create a free Y-DNA dedicated bioinformatics resource.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

The most widely used organism for these studies is the free-living flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea. In 2007, the Schmidtea mediterranea Genome Database (SmedGD) was first released to provide a much needed resource for the small, but growing planarian community. SmedGD 1.0 has been a depository for genome sequence, a draft assembly, and related experimental data (e.g., RNAi phenotypes, in situ hybridization images, and differential gene expression results). We report here a comprehensive update to SmedGD (SmedGD 2.0) that aims to expand its role as an interactive community resource. The new database includes more recent, and up-to-date transcription data, provides tools that enhance interconnectivity between different genome assemblies and transcriptomes, including next-generation assemblies for both the sexual and asexual biotypes of S. mediterranea. SmedGD 2.0 (http://smedgd.stowers.org) not only provides significantly improved gene annotations, but also tools for data sharing, attributes that will help both the planarian and biomedical communities to more efficiently mine the genomics and transcriptomics of S. mediterranea.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Therefore, understanding of miRNA regulatory networks is essential in order to modulate the functions of a miRNA. The focus of several existing databases is to provide information on specific aspects of miRNA regulation. However, an integrated resource on the miRNA regulome is currently not available to facilitate the exploration and understanding of miRNA regulomics. miRegulome attempts to bridge this gap. The current version of miRegulome v1.0 provides details on the entire regulatory modules of miRNAs altered in response to chemical treatments and transcription factors, based on validated data manually curated from published literature. Modules of miRegulome (upstream regulators, downstream targets, miRNA regulated pathways, functions, diseases, etc) are hyperlinked to an appropriate external resource and are displayed visually to provide a comprehensive understanding. Four analysis tools are incorporated to identify relationships among different modules based on user specified datasets. miRegulome and its tools are helpful in understanding the biology of miRNAs and will also facilitate the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutics. With added features in upcoming releases, miRegulome will be an essential resource to the scientific community.<h4>Availability</h4>http://bnet.egr.vcu.edu/miRegulome.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Although such collections of naturally occurring language errors are invaluable for a number of reasons, the process of collecting various types of speech errors presents many challenges to the researcher interested in building such a collection, among them a significant investment of time and effort to obtain a sufficient number of examples to enable statistical analysis. Here we describe a freely accessible website http://spedi.ku.edu that helps users document slips of the tongue, slips of the ear, and tip of the tongue states that they experience firsthand or observe in others. The documented errors are amassed, and made available for other users to analyze, thereby distributing the time and effort involved in collecting errors across a large number of individuals instead of saddling the lone researcher, and facilitating distribution of the collection to other researchers. This approach also addresses some issues related to data curation that hampered previous error collections, and enables the collection to continue to grow over a longer period of time than previous collections. Finally, this web-based tool creates an opportunity for language scientists to engage in outreach efforts to increase the understanding of language disorders and research in the general public.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,tentative 1; Is this biodata?,

The narrow genetic diversity and limited availability of genomic resources are the major constraints in implementing breeding strategies and biotechnological interventions for genetic enhancement of chickpea. We developed an integrated Chickpea Transcriptome Database (CTDB), which provides the comprehensive web interface for visualization and easy retrieval of transcriptome data in chickpea. The database features many tools for similarity search, functional annotation (putative function, PFAM domain and gene ontology) search and comparative gene expression analysis. The current release of CTDB (v2.0) hosts transcriptome datasets with high quality functional annotation from cultivated (desi and kabuli types) and wild chickpea. A catalog of transcription factor families and their expression profiles in chickpea are available in the database. The gene expression data have been integrated to study the expression profiles of chickpea transcripts in major tissues/organs and various stages of flower development. The utilities, such as similarity search, ortholog identification and comparative gene expression have also been implemented in the database to facilitate comparative genomic studies among different legumes and Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the CTDB represents a resource for the discovery of functional molecular markers (microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms) between different chickpea types. We anticipate that integrated information content of this database will accelerate the functional and applied genomic research for improvement of chickpea.

26387108,The Protein Ensemble Database.,"The scientific community's major conceptual notion of structural biology has recently shifted in emphasis from the classical structure-function paradigm due to the emergence of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). As opposed to their folded cousins, these proteins are defined by the lack of a stable 3D fold and a high degree of inherent structural heterogeneity that is closely tied to their function. Due to their flexible nature, solution techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are particularly well-suited for characterizing their biophysical properties. Computationally derived structural ensembles based on such experimental measurements provide models of the conformational sampling displayed by these proteins, and they may offer valuable insights into the functional consequences of inherent flexibility. The Protein Ensemble Database (http://pedb.vib.be) is the first openly accessible, manually curated online resource storing the ensemble models, protocols used during the calculation procedure, and underlying primary experimental data derived from SAXS and/or NMR measurements. By making this previously inaccessible data freely available to researchers, this novel resource is expected to promote the development of more advanced modelling methodologies, facilitate the design of standardized calculation protocols, and consequently lead to a better understanding of how function arises from the disordered state.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

This provides the scientific community with the necessary information to derive trends about privileged physicochemical properties and chemotypes that maximize the likelihood of promoting a given chemical probe to the most advanced stages of development. To this end we have developed iPPI-DB (freely accessible at http://www.ippidb.cdithem.fr), a database that contains the structure, some physicochemical characteristics, the pharmacological data and the profile of the PPI targets of several hundreds modulators of protein-protein interactions. iPPI-DB is accessible through a web application and can be queried according to two general approaches: using physicochemical/pharmacological criteria; or by chemical similarity to a user-defined structure input. In both cases the results are displayed as a sortable and exportable datasheet with links to external databases such as Uniprot, PubMed. Furthermore each compound in the table has a link to an individual ID card that contains its physicochemical and pharmacological profile derived from iPPI-DB data. This includes information about its binding data, ligand and lipophilic efficiencies, location in the PPI chemical space, and importantly similarity with known drugs, and links to external databases like PubChem, and ChEMBL.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Approximately two decades of investigation and the creation of more than 130 mouse models of polyQ disorders have revealed many similarities between these diseases. The disorders share common mutation types, neurological characteristics and certain aspects of pathogenesis, including morphological and physiological neuronal alterations. All of the diseases still remain incurable.<h4>Description</h4>The large volume of information collected as a result of the investigation of polyQ models currently represents a great potential for searching, comparing and translating pathogenesis and therapeutic information between diseases. Therefore, we generated a public database comprising the polyQ mouse models, phenotypes and therapeutic interventions tested in vivo. The database is available at http://conyza.man.poznan.pl/ .<h4>Conclusion</h4>The use of the database in the field of polyQ diseases may accelerate research on these and other neurodegenerative diseases and provide new perspectives for future investigation.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

In this paper, we describe the database InterRNA (INTERactions in RNA structures database-http://mfrlab.org/interrna/) that contains records of known RNA 3D motifs as well as records for clusters of bases that are interconnected by hydrogen bonds. The contents of the database were compiled from RNA structural annotations carried out by the NASSAM (http://mfrlab.org/grafss/nassam) and COGNAC (http://mfrlab.org/grafss/cognac) computer programs. An analysis of the database content and comparisons with the existing corpus of knowledge regarding RNA 3D motifs clearly show that InterRNA is able to provide an extension of the annotations for known motifs as well as able to provide novel interactions for further investigations.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
26582915,piRNA cluster database: a web resource for piRNA producing loci.,"Piwi proteins and their guiding small RNAs, termed Piwi-interacting (pi-) RNAs, are essential for silencing of transposons in the germline of animals. A substantial fraction of piRNAs originates from genomic loci termed piRNA clusters and sequences encoded in these piRNA clusters determine putative targets for the Piwi/piRNA system. In the past decade, studies of piRNA transcriptomes in different species revealed additional roles for piRNAs beyond transposon silencing, reflecting the astonishing plasticity of the Piwi/piRNA system along different phylogenetic branches. Moreover, piRNA transcriptomes can change drastically during development and vary across different tissues.Since piRNA clusters crucially shape piRNA profiles, analysis of these loci is imperative for a thorough understanding of functional and evolutionary aspects of the piRNA pathway. But despite the ever-growing amount of available piRNA sequence data, we know little about the factors that determine differential regulation of piRNA clusters, nor the evolutionary events that cause their gain or loss.In order to facilitate addressing these subjects, we established a user-friendly piRNA cluster database (http://www.smallrnagroup-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB.html) that provides comprehensive data on piRNA clusters in multiple species, tissues and developmental stages based on small RNA sequence data deposited at NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA).","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Since its development in 2012, the Tumor Suppressor Gene database (TSGene), has become a popular resource in the cancer research community. Here, we reported the TSGene version 2.0, which has substantial updates of contents (e.g. up-to-date literature and pan-cancer genomic data collection and curation), data types (noncoding RNAs and protein-coding genes) and content accessibility. Specifically, the current TSGene 2.0 contains 1217 human TSGs (1018 protein-coding and 199 non-coding genes) curated from over 9000 articles. Additionally, TSGene 2.0 provides thousands of expression and mutation patterns derived from pan-cancer data of The Cancer Genome Atlas. A new web interface is available at http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/TSGene/. Systematic analyses of 199 non-coding TSGs provide numerous cancer-specific non-coding mutational events for further screening and clinical use. Intriguingly, we identified 49 protein-coding TSGs that were consistently down-regulated in 11 cancer types. In summary, TSGene 2.0, which is the only available database for TSGs, provides the most updated TSGs and their features in pan-cancer.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

The initial release of Dfam, featured in the 2013 NAR Database Issue, contained 1143 families of repetitive elements found in humans, and was used to produce more than 100 Mb of additional annotation of TE-derived regions in the human genome, with improved speed. Here, we describe recent advances, most notably expansion to 4150 total families including a comprehensive set of known repeat families from four new organisms (mouse, zebrafish, fly and nematode).

Here, we have developed the Algae Gene Coexpression database (ALCOdb; http://alcodb.jp), which provides gene coexpression information to survey gene modules for a function of interest. ALCOdb currently supports two model algae: the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Users can retrieve coexpression information for genes of interest through three unique data pages: (i) Coexpressed Gene List; (ii) Gene Information; and (iii) Coexpressed Gene Network. In addition to the basal coexpression information, ALCOdb also provides several advanced functionalities such as an expression profile viewer and a differentially expressed gene search tool. Using these user interfaces, we demonstrated that our gene coexpression data have the potential to detect functionally related genes and are useful in extrapolating the biological roles of uncharacterized genes. ALCOdb will facilitate molecular and biochemical studies of microalgal biological phenomena, such as lipid metabolism and organelle development, and promote the evolutionary understanding of plant cellular systems.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

These networks play critical roles in many fundamental mechanisms, such as plant growth, development and environmental response. Although much is known about these complex interactions, the knowledge and data are currently scattered throughout the published literature, publicly available high-throughput data sets and third-party databases. Many 'unknown' yet important interactions among genes need to be mined and established through extensive computational analysis. However, exploring these complex biological interactions at the network level from existing heterogeneous resources remains challenging and time-consuming for biologists. Here, we introduce HRGRN, a graph search-empowered integrative database of Arabidopsis signal transduction, metabolism and gene regulatory networks. HRGRN utilizes Neo4j, which is a highly scalable graph database management system, to host large-scale biological interactions among genes, proteins, compounds and small RNAs that were either validated experimentally or predicted computationally. The associated biological pathway information was also specially marked for the interactions that are involved in the pathway to facilitate the investigation of cross-talk between pathways. Furthermore, HRGRN integrates a series of graph path search algorithms to discover novel relationships among genes, compounds, RNAs and even pathways from heterogeneous biological interaction data that could be missed by traditional SQL database search methods. Users can also build subnetworks based on known interactions. The outcomes are visualized with rich text, figures and interactive network graphs on web pages.

In dbEM, modifiers are classified on functional basis and comprise of 48 histone methyl transferases, 33 chromatin remodelers and 31 histone demethylases. dbEM maintains the genomic information like mutations, copy number variation and gene expression in thousands of tumor samples, cancer cell lines and healthy samples. This information is obtained from public resources viz. COSMIC, CCLE and 1000-genome project. Gene essentiality data retrieved from COLT database further highlights the importance of various epigenetic proteins for cancer survival. We have also reported the sequence profiles, tertiary structures and post-translational modifications of these epigenetic proteins in cancer. It also contains information of 54 drug molecules against different epigenetic proteins. A wide range of tools have been integrated in dbEM e.g. Search, BLAST, Alignment and Profile based prediction. In our analysis, we found that epigenetic proteins DNMT3A, HDAC2, KDM6A, and TET2 are highly mutated in variety of cancers.

Both in normal and aberrant activities, miRNAs contribute to a recurring paradigm of cellular behaviors in pathological settings, especially in gerontology. Autophagy, a multi-step lysosomal degradation process with function to degrade long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, has significant impact on gerontology. Thus, elucidating how miRNAs participate in autophagy may enlarge the scope of miRNA in autophagy and facilitate researches in gerontology.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Herein, based upon the published studies, predicted targets and gerontology-related diseases, we constructed a web resource named Gerontology-Autophagic-MicroRNA Database (GAMDB) (http://gamdb.liu-lab.com/index.php), which contained 836 autophagy-related miRNAs, 197 targeted genes/proteins and 56 aging-related diseases such as Parkinson' disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>We made use of large amounts of data to elucidate the intricate relationships between microRNA-regulated autophagic mechanisms and gerontology.

This pattern of base pairing, known as RNA secondary structure, is critical to their cellular function. Recently several diverse methods have been developed to assay RNA secondary structure on a transcriptome-wide scale using high-throughput sequencing. Each approach has its own strengths and caveats, however there is no widely available tool for visualizing and comparing the results from these varied methods.<h4>Methods</h4>To address this, we have developed Structure Surfer, a database and visualization tool for inspecting RNA secondary structure in six transcriptome-wide data sets from human and mouse ( http://tesla.pcbi.upenn.edu/strucuturesurfer/ ). The data sets were generated using four different high-throughput sequencing based methods. Each one was analyzed with a scoring pipeline specific to its experimental design. Users of Structure Surfer have the ability to query individual loci as well as detect trends across multiple sites.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we describe the included data sets and their differences. We illustrate the database's function by examining known structural elements and we explore example use cases in which combined data is used to detect structural trends.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In total, Structure Surfer provides an easy-to-use database and visualization interface for allowing users to interrogate the currently available transcriptome-wide RNA secondary structure information for mammals.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Here we addressed the question, """"What E3 ubiquitin ligase is most likely to be responsible for AQP2 ubiquitination?"""" using large-scale data integration based on Bayes' rule. The first step was to bioinformatically identify all E3 ligase genes coded by the human genome. The 377 E3 ubiquitin ligases identified in the human genome, consisting predominant of HECT, RING, and U-box proteins, have been used to create a publically accessible and downloadable online database (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/E3-ligases/). We also curated a second database of E3 ligase accessory proteins that included BTB domain proteins, cullins, SOCS-box proteins, and F-box proteins. Using Bayes' theorem to integrate information from multiple large-scale proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, we ranked these 377 E3 ligases with respect to their probability of interaction with AQP2. Application of Bayes' rule identified the E3 ligases most likely to interact with AQP2 as (in order of probability): NEDD4 and NEDD4L (tied for first), AMFR, STUB1, ITCH, ZFPL1. Significantly, the two E3 ligases tied for top rank have also been studied extensively in the reductionist literature as regulatory proteins in renal tubule epithelia. The concordance of conclusions from reductionist and systems-level data provides strong motivation for further studies of the roles of NEDD4 and NEDD4L in the regulation of AQP2 protein turnover.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

In the era of high-throughput omics biology, the most used technologies for these purposes are microarray and RNA-Seq, whose data are usually required to be deposited in public repositories upon publication. Such repositories have the enormous potential to provide a comprehensive view of how different experimental conditions lead to expression changes, by comparing gene expression across all possible measured conditions. Unfortunately, this task is greatly impaired by differences among experimental platforms that make direct comparisons difficult. In this paper, we present the Vitis Expression Studies Platform Using COLOMBOS Compendia Instances (VESPUCCI), a gene expression compendium for grapevine which was built by adapting an approach originally developed for bacteria, and show how it can be used to investigate complex gene expression patterns. We integrated nearly all publicly available microarray and RNA-Seq expression data: 1608 gene expression samples from 10 different technological platforms. Each sample has been manually annotated using a controlled vocabulary developed ad hoc to ensure both human readability and computational tractability. Expression data in the compendium can be visually explored using several tools provided by the web interface or can be programmatically accessed using the REST interface.

Genetic studies, especially recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified multiple variants (loci) conferring risk to SZ. However, how to efficiently extract meaningful biological information from bulk genetic findings of SZ remains a major challenge. There is a pressing need to integrate multiple layers of data from various sources, eg, genetic findings from GWAS, copy number variations (CNVs), association and linkage studies, gene expression, protein-protein interaction (PPI), co-expression, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data, to provide a comprehensive resource to facilitate the translation of genetic findings into SZ molecular diagnosis and mechanism study. Here we developed the SZDB database (http://www.szdb.org/), a comprehensive resource for SZ research. SZ genetic data, gene expression data, network-based data, brain eQTL data, and SNP function annotation information were systematically extracted, curated and deposited in SZDB. In-depth analyses and systematic integration were performed to identify top prioritized SZ genes and enriched pathways. Multiple types of data from various layers of SZ research were systematically integrated and deposited in SZDB. In-depth data analyses and integration identified top prioritized SZ genes and enriched pathways. We further showed that genes implicated in SZ are highly co-expressed in human brain and proteins encoded by the prioritized SZ risk genes are significantly interacted. The user-friendly SZDB provides high-confidence candidate variants and genes for further functional characterization.

27484196,iLIR database: A web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in eukaryotes.,"Atg8-family proteins are the best-studied proteins of the core autophagic machinery. They are essential for the elongation and closure of the phagophore into a proper autophagosome. Moreover, Atg8-family proteins are associated with the phagophore from the initiation of the autophagic process to, or just prior to, the fusion between autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition to their implication in autophagosome biogenesis, they are crucial for selective autophagy through their ability to interact with selective autophagy receptor proteins necessary for the specific targeting of substrates for autophagic degradation. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of them in the past 10years. Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in various organisms, we developed the iLIR database ( https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk ) as a freely available web resource, listing all the putative canonical LIRCPs identified in silico in the proteomes of 8 model organisms using the iLIR server, combined with a Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis.

27794041,NGSmethDB 2017: enhanced methylomes and differential methylation.,"The 2017 update of NGSmethDB stores whole genome methylomes generated from short-read data sets obtained by bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology. To generate high-quality methylomes, stringent quality controls were integrated with third-part software, adding also a two-step mapping process to exploit the advantages of the new genome assembly models. The samples were all profiled under constant parameter settings, thus enabling comparative downstream analyses. Besides a significant increase in the number of samples, NGSmethDB now includes two additional data-types, which are a valuable resource for the discovery of methylation epigenetic biomarkers: (i) differentially methylated single-cytosines; and (ii) methylation segments (i.e. genome regions of homogeneous methylation). The NGSmethDB back-end is now based on MongoDB, a NoSQL hierarchical database using JSON-formatted documents and dynamic schemas, thus accelerating sample comparative analyses. Besides conventional database dumps, track hubs were implemented, which improved database access, visualization in genome browsers and comparative analyses to third-part annotations. In addition, the database can be also accessed through a RESTful API. Lastly, a Python client and a multiplatform virtual machine allow for program-driven access from user desktop. This way, private methylation data can be compared to NGSmethDB without the need to upload them to public servers. Database website: http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/NGSmethDB.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
27841751,A public database of macromolecular diffraction experiments.,"The low reproducibility of published experimental results in many scientific disciplines has recently garnered negative attention in scientific journals and the general media. Public transparency, including the availability of `raw' experimental data, will help to address growing concerns regarding scientific integrity. Macromolecular X-ray crystallography has led the way in requiring the public dissemination of atomic coordinates and a wealth of experimental data, making the field one of the most reproducible in the biological sciences. However, there remains no mandate for public disclosure of the original diffraction data. The Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography (IRRMC) has been developed to archive raw data from diffraction experiments and, equally importantly, to provide related metadata. Currently, the database of our resource contains data from 2920 macromolecular diffraction experiments (5767 data sets), accounting for around 3% of all depositions in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with their corresponding partially curated metadata. IRRMC utilizes distributed storage implemented using a federated architecture of many independent storage servers, which provides both scalability and sustainability. The resource, which is accessible via the web portal at http://www.proteindiffraction.org, can be searched using various criteria. All data are available for unrestricted access and download. The resource serves as a proof of concept and demonstrates the feasibility of archiving raw diffraction data and associated metadata from X-ray crystallographic studies of biological macromolecules. The goal is to expand this resource and include data sets that failed to yield X-ray structures in order to facilitate collaborative efforts that will improve protein structure-determination methods and to ensure the availability of `orphan' data left behind for various reasons by individual investigators and/or extinct structural genomics projects.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

In the updated YM500v3 database (http://ngs.ym.edu.tw/ym500/) presented herein, we not only focus on miRNAs but also on other functional small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), such as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). There is growing knowledge of the role of sncRNAs in gene regulation and tumorigenesis. We have also incorporated >10 000 cancer-related RNA-seq and >3000 more smRNA-seq data sets into the YM500v3 database. Furthermore, there are two main new sections, 'Survival' and 'Cancer', in this updated version. The 'Survival' section provides the survival analysis results in all cancer types or in a user-defined group of samples for a specific sncRNA. The 'Cancer' section provides the results of differential expression analyses, miRNA-gene interactions and cancer miRNA-related pathways. In the 'Expression' section, sncRNA expression profiles across cancer and sample types are newly provided. Cancer-related sncRNAs hold potential for both biotech applications and basic research.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
27980519,<i>ContaMiner</i> and ContaBase: a webserver and database for early identification of unwantedly crystallized protein contaminants.,"Solving the phase problem in protein X-ray crystallography relies heavily on the identity of the crystallized protein, especially when molecular replacement (MR) methods are used. Yet, it is not uncommon that a contaminant crystallizes instead of the protein of interest. Such contaminants may be proteins from the expression host organism, protein fusion tags or proteins added during the purification steps. Many contaminants co-purify easily, crystallize and give good diffraction data. Identification of contaminant crystals may take time, since the presence of the contaminant is unexpected and its identity unknown. A webserver (<i>ContaMiner</i>) and a contaminant database (ContaBase) have been established, to allow fast MR-based screening of crystallographic data against currently 62 known contaminants. The web-based <i>ContaMiner</i> (available at http://strube.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/contaminer/) currently produces results in 5 min to 4 h. The program is also available in a github repository and can be installed locally. <i>ContaMiner</i> enables screening of novel crystals at synchrotron beamlines, and it would be valuable as a routine safety check for 'crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis' publications. Thus, in addition to potentially saving X-ray crystallographers much time and effort, <i>ContaMiner</i> might considerably lower the risk of publishing erroneous data.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
28090394,GExplore 1.4: An expanded web interface for queries on <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> protein and gene function.,"Genetic high-throughput experiments often result in hundreds or thousands of genes satisfying certain experimental conditions. Grouping and prioritizing a large number of genes for further analysis can be a time-consuming challenge. In 2009 we developed a web-based user interface, GExplore, to assist with large-scale data-mining related to gene function in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The underlying database contained information about <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> genes and proteins including domain organization of the proteins, phenotypic descriptions, expression data and Gene Ontology Consortium annotations. These data enable users to quickly obtain an overview of biological and biochemical functions of a large number of genes at once. Since its inception the underlying database has been updated and expanded significantly. Here we describe the current version of GExplore 1.4, documenting the changes since the original release. GExplore 1.4 now contains information about the domain organization of the proteomes of 9 nematode species, can display the location of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> mutations with respect to the domain organization of the proteins, and includes stage-specific RNAseq gene expression data generated by the modENCODE project. The underlying database has been reorganized to facilitate independent updates of the different parts of the database and to allow the addition of novel data sets in the future.

28149703,Expanding our understanding of the trade in marine aquarium animals.,"The trade of live marine animals for home and public aquaria has grown into a major global industry. Millions of marine fishes and invertebrates are removed from coral reefs and associated habitats each year. The majority are imported into the United States, with the remainder sent to Europe, Japan, and a handful of other countries. Despite the recent growth and diversification of the aquarium trade, to date, data collection is not mandatory, and hence comprehensive information on species volume and diversity is lacking. This lack of information makes it impossible to study trade pathways. Without species-specific volume and diversity data, it is unclear how importing and exporting governments can oversee this industry effectively or how sustainability should be encouraged. To expand our knowledge and understanding of the trade, and to effectively communicate this new understanding, we introduce the publically-available Marine Aquarium Biodiversity and Trade Flow online database (https://www.aquariumtradedata.org/). This tool was created to communicate the volume and diversity of marine fishes and/or invertebrates imported into the US over three complete years (2008, 2009, and 2011) and three partial years (2000, 2004, 2005). To create this tool, invoices pertaining to shipments of live marine fishes and invertebrates were scanned and analyzed for species name, species quantities, country of origin, port of entry, and city of import destination. Here we focus on the analysis of the later three years of data and also produce an estimate for the entirety of 2000, 2004, and 2005. The three-year aggregate totals (2008, 2009, 2011) indicate that just under 2,300 fish and 725 invertebrate species were imported into the US cumulatively, although just under 1,800 fish and 550 invertebrate species were traded annually. Overall, the total number of live marine animals decreased between 2008 and 2011. In 2008, 2009, and 2011, the total number of individual fish (8.2, 7.3, and 6.9 million individuals) and invertebrates (4.2, 3.7, and 3.6 million individuals) assessed by analyzing the invoice data are roughly 60% of the total volumes recorded through the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) dataset. Using these complete years, we back-calculated the number of individuals of both fishes and invertebrates imported in 2000, 2004, and 2005. These estimates (9.3, 10.8, and 11.2 million individual fish per year) were consistent with the three years of complete data. We also use these data to understand the global trade in two species (Banggai cardinalfish, <i>Pterapogon kauderni</i>, and orange clownfish, <i>Amphiprion ocellaris</i> / <i>percula</i>) recently considered for Endangered Species Act listing. Aquariumtradedata.org can help create more effective management plans for the traded species, and ideally could be implemented at key trade ports to better assess the global trade of aquatic wildlife.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Deep-sequencing technology has been widely adopted in miRNA investigations. However, it is still a big mysterious why nearly all sequencing data contain miRNA sequences from exogenous species, called exo-miRNAs. In this study, we developed a novel platform, exo-miRExplorer, for mining and identifying exo-miRNAs from high-throughput small RNA sequencing experiments which originated from tissues and cell lines of multiple organisms. Thousands of exo-miRNAs are characterized with their expression abundance, the RNA families, original organisms and the sequencing platforms presented in exo-miRExplorer. Subsequently, we used exo-miRExplorer to perform further analysis. Comparative analysis of the exo-miRNAs between different sequencing datasets revealed significant correlation of exo-miRNAs between experiments in the same study. The plant-derived exo-miRNAs analysis provided robust evidence for non-diet source of exo-miRNAs. Virus-derived exo-miRNA analysis showed that pathogen RNAs could transfer to host cells and exist in deep-sequencing result at abundance level. In conclusion, exo-miRExplorer provides users with an integrative resource to facilitate detection and analysis of exo-miRNAs. exo-miRExplorer is available at the following URL: http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/exomiRDB/.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

While results from rodent malaria transfections have been curated and systematised, empowering large-scale analysis, phenotypic data from human malaria parasite transfections currently exists as individual reports scattered across a the literature. To facilitate systematic analysis of published experimental genetic data across <i>Plasmodium</i> species, we have built PhenoPlasm ( http://www.phenoplasm.org), a database of phenotypes generated by transfection experiments in all <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites. The site provides a simple interface linking citation-backed <i>Plasmodium</i> reverse-genetic phenotypes to gene IDs. The database has been populated with phenotypic data on 367 <i>P. falciparum</i> genes, curated from 176 individual publications, as well as existing data on rodent <i>Plasmodium</i> species from RMgmDB and PlasmoGEM. This is the first time that all available data on <i>P. falciparum</i> transfection experiments has been brought together in a single place. These data are presented using ortholog mapping to allow a researcher interested in a gene in one species to see results across other <i>Plasmodium</i> species. The collaborative nature of the database enables any researcher to add new phenotypes as they are discovered. As an example of database utility, we use the currently available datasets to identify RAP (RNA-binding domain abundant in Apicomplexa)-domain containing proteins as crucial to parasite survival.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

28985416,EVLncRNAs: a manually curated database for long non-coding RNAs validated by low-throughput experiments.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important functional roles in various biological processes. Early databases were utilized to deposit all lncRNA candidates produced by high-throughput experimental and/or computational techniques to facilitate classification, assessment and validation. As more lncRNAs are validated by low-throughput experiments, several databases were established for experimentally validated lncRNAs. However, these databases are small in scale (with a few hundreds of lncRNAs only) and specific in their focuses (plants, diseases or interactions). Thus, it is highly desirable to have a comprehensive dataset for experimentally validated lncRNAs as a central repository for all of their structures, functions and phenotypes. Here, we established EVLncRNAs by curating lncRNAs validated by low-throughput experiments (up to 1 May 2016) and integrating specific databases (lncRNAdb, LncRANDisease, Lnc2Cancer and PLNIncRBase) with additional functional and disease-specific information not covered previously. The current version of EVLncRNAs contains 1543 lncRNAs from 77 species that is 2.9 times larger than the current largest database for experimentally validated lncRNAs.

29155231,RTFAdb: A database of computationally predicted associations between retrotransposons and transcription factors in the human and mouse genomes.,"In recent years, retrotransposons have gained increasing attention as a source of binding motifs for transcription factors (TFs). Despite the substantial roles of these mobile genetic elements in the regulation of gene expression, a comprehensive resource enabling the investigation of retrotransposon species that are bound by TFs is still lacking. Herein, I introduce for the first time a novel database called RTFAdb, which allows exploring computationally predicted associations between retrotransposons and TFs in diverse cell lines and tissues of human and mouse. My database, using over 3.000 TF ChIP-seq binding profiles collected from human and mouse samples, makes possible searching more than 1.500 retrotransposon species in the binding sites of a total of 596 TFs. RTFAdb is freely available at http://tools.ibg.deu.edu.tr/rtfa/ and has the potential to offer novel insights into mammalian transcriptional networks by providing an additional layer of information regarding the regulatory roles of retrotransposons.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
29209336,DRDB: An Online Date Palm Genomic Resource Database.,"Background: Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is a cultivated woody plant with agricultural and economic importance in many countries around the world. With the advantages of next generation sequencing technologies, genome sequences for many date palm cultivars have been released recently. Short sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be identified from these genomic data, and have been proven to be very useful biomarkers in plant genome analysis and breeding. Results: Here, we first improved the date palm genome assembly using 130X of HiSeq data generated in our lab. Then 246,445 SSRs (214,901 SSRs and 31,544 compound SSRs) were annotated in this genome assembly; among the SSRs, mononucleotide SSRs (58.92%) were the most abundant, followed by di- (29.92%), tri- (8.14%), tetra- (2.47%), penta- (0.36%), and hexa-nucleotide SSRs (0.19%). The high-quality PCR primer pairs were designed for most (174,497; 70.81% out of total) SSRs. We also annotated 6,375,806 SNPs with raw read depth=3 in 90% cultivars. To further reduce false positive SNPs, we only kept 5,572,650 (87.40% out of total) SNPs with at least 20% cultivars support for downstream analyses. The high-quality PCR primer pairs were also obtained for 4,177,778 (65.53%) SNPs. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among the 62 cultivars using these variants and found that they can be divided into three clusters, namely North Africa, Egypt - Sudan, and Middle East - South Asian, with Egypt - Sudan being the admixture of North Africa and Middle East - South Asian cultivars; we further confirmed these clusters using principal component analysis. Moreover, 34,346 SSRs and 4,177,778 SNPs with PCR primers were assigned to shared cultivars for cultivar classification and diversity analysis. All these SSRs, SNPs and their classification are available in our database, and can be used for cultivar identification, comparison, and molecular breeding. Conclusion:DRDB is a comprehensive genomic resource database of date palm. It can serve as a bioinformatics platform for date palm genomics, genetics, and molecular breeding.

29315358,HTT-DB: new features and updates.,"Horizontal Transfer (HT) of genetic material between species is a common phenomenon among Bacteria and Archaea species and several databases are available for information retrieval and data mining. However, little attention has been given to this phenomenon among eukaryotic species mainly due to the lower proportion of these events. In the last years, a vertiginous amount of new HT events involving eukaryotic species was reported in the literature, highlighting the need of a common repository to keep the scientific community up to date and describe overall trends. Recently, we published the first HT database focused on HT of transposable elements among eukaryotes: the Horizontal Transposon Transfer DataBase (http://lpa.saogabriel.unipampa.edu.br: 8080/httdatabase/). Here, we present new features and updates of this unique database: (i) its expansion to include virus-host exchange of genetic material, which we called Horizontal Virus Transfer (HVT) and (ii) the availability of a web server for HT detection, where we implemented the online version of vertical and horizontal inheritance consistence analysis (VHICA), an R package developed for HT detection. These improvements will help researchers to navigate through known HVT cases, take data-informed decision and export figures based on keywords searches. Moreover, the availability of the VHICA as an online tool will make this software easily reachable even for researchers with no or little computation knowledge as well as foster our capability to detect new HT events in a wide variety of taxa.

29617941,A reference peptide database for proteome quantification based on experimental mass spectrum response curves.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mass spectrometry (MS) based quantification of proteins/peptides has become a powerful tool in biological research with high sensitivity and throughput. The accuracy of quantification, however, has been problematic as not all peptides are suitable for quantification. Several methods and tools have been developed to identify peptides that response well in mass spectrometry and they are mainly based on predictive models, and rarely consider the linearity of the response curve, limiting the accuracy and applicability of the methods. An alternative solution is to select empirically superior peptides that offer satisfactory MS response intensity and linearity in a wide dynamic range of peptide concentration.<h4>Results</h4>We constructed a reference database for proteome quantification based on experimental mass spectrum response curves. The intensity and dynamic range of over 2 647 773 transitions from 121 318 peptides were obtained from a set of dilution experiments, covering 11 040 gene products. These transitions and peptides were evaluated and presented in a database named SCRIPT-MAP. We showed that the best-responder (BR) peptide approach for quantification based on SCRIPT-MAP database is robust, repeatable and accurate in proteome-scale protein quantification. This study provides a reference database as well as a peptides/transitions selection method for quantitative proteomics.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>SCRIPT-MAP database is available at http://www.firmiana.org/responders/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
29662024,"PKIDB: A Curated, Annotated and Updated Database of Protein Kinase Inhibitors in Clinical Trials.","The number of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) approved worldwide continues to grow steadily, with 39 drugs approved in the period between 2001 and January 2018. PKIs on the market have been the subject of many reviews, and structure-property relationships specific to this class of drugs have been inferred. However, the large number of PKIs under development is often overlooked. In this paper, we present PKIDB (Protein Kinase Inhibitor Database), a monthly-updated database gathering approved PKIs as well as PKIs currently in clinical trials. The database compiles currently 180 inhibitors ranging from phase 0 to 4 clinical trials along with annotations extracted from seven public resources. The distribution and property ranges of standard physicochemical properties are presented. They can be used as filters to better prioritize compound selection for future screening campaigns. Interestingly, more than one-third of the kinase inhibitors violate at least one Lipinski's rule. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals that Type-II inhibitors are mapped to a distinct chemical space as compared to orally administrated drugs as well as to other types of kinase inhibitors. Using a Principal Moment of Inertia (PMI) analysis, we show that PKIs under development tend to explore new shape territories as compared to approved PKIs. In order to facilitate the analysis of the protein space, the kinome tree has been annotated with all protein kinases being targeted by PKIs. Finally, we analyzed the pipeline of the pharmaceutical companies having PKIs on the market or still under development. We hope that this work will assist researchers in the kinase field in identifying and designing the next generation of kinase inhibitors for still untargeted kinases. The PKIDB database is freely accessible from a website at http://www.icoa.fr/pkidb and can be easily browsed through a user-friendly spreadsheet-like interface.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
29743053,PDXliver: a database of liver cancer patient derived xenograft mouse models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and characterized by heterogeneity and drug resistance. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been widely used in cancer research because they reproduce the characteristics of original tumors. However, the current studies of liver cancer PDX mice are scattered and the number of available PDX models are too small to represent the heterogeneity of liver cancer patients. To improve this situation and to complement available PDX models related resources, here we constructed a comprehensive database, PDXliver, to integrate and analyze liver cancer PDX models.<h4>Description</h4>Currently, PDXliver contains 116 PDX models from Chinese liver cancer patients, 51 of them were established by the in-house PDX platform and others were curated from the public literatures. These models are annotated with complete information, including clinical characteristics of patients, genome-wide expression profiles, germline variations, somatic mutations and copy number alterations. Analysis of expression subtypes and mutated genes show that PDXliver represents the diversity of human patients. Another feature of PDXliver is storing drug response data of PDX mice, which makes it possible to explore the association between molecular profiles and drug sensitivity. All data can be accessed via the Browse and Search pages. Additionally, two tools are provided to interactively visualize the omics data of selected PDXs or to compare two groupsof PDXs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As far as we known, PDXliver is the first public database of liver cancer PDX models. We hope that this comprehensive resource will accelerate the utility of PDX models and facilitate liver cancer research.

We developed the FlyXCDB database (http://prodata.swmed.edu/FlyXCDB) that provides a comprehensive resource to investigate extracellular (XC) domains in CSS proteins of Drosophila melanogaster, the most studied insect model organism in various aspects of animal biology. More than 300 Drosophila XC domains were discovered in Drosophila CSS proteins encoded by over 2500 genes through analyses of computational predictions of signal peptide, transmembrane (TM) segment, and GPI-anchor signal sequence, profile-based sequence similarity searches, gene ontology, and literature. These domains were classified into six classes mainly based on their molecular functions, including protein-protein interactions (class P), signaling molecules (class S), binding of non-protein molecules or groups (class B), enzyme homologs (class E), enzyme regulation and inhibition (class R), and unknown molecular function (class U). Main cellular functions such as cell adhesion, cell signaling, and extracellular matrix composition were described for the most abundant domains in each functional class. We assigned cell membrane topology categories (E, secreted; S, type I/III single-pass TM; T, type II single-pass TM; M, multi-pass TM; and G, GPI-anchored) to the products of genes with XC domains and investigated their regulation by mechanisms such as alternative splicing and stop codon readthrough.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Inaccurate and delayed diagnoses increase the risk, especially in developing countries. Studies have indicated the significant roles of genetic elements in ILDs pathogenesis. Therefore, the first genetic knowledge resource, ILDgenDB, has been developed with an objective to provide ILDs genetic data and their integrated analyses for the better understanding of disease pathogenesis and identification of diagnostics-based biomarkers. This resource contains literature-curated disease candidate genes (DCGs) enriched with various regulatory elements that have been generated using an integrated bioinformatics workflow of databases searches, literature-mining and DCGs-microRNA (miRNAs)-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) association analyses. To provide statistical significance to disease-gene association, ILD-specificity index and hypergeomatric test scores were also incorporated. Association analyses of miRNAs, SNPs and pathways responsible for the pathogenesis of different sub-classes of ILDs were also incorporated. Manually verified 299 DCGs and their significant associations with 1932 SNPs, 2966 miRNAs and 9170 miR-polymorphisms were also provided. Furthermore, 216 literature-mined and proposed biomarkers were identified. The ILDgenDB resource provides user-friendly browsing and extensive query-based information retrieval systems. Additionally, this resource also facilitates graphical view of predicted DCGs-SNPs/miRNAs and literature associated DCGs-ILDs interactions for each ILD to facilitate efficient data interpretation. Outcomes of analyses suggested the significant involvement of immune system and defense mechanisms in ILDs pathogenesis.

Essential oils widely used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, sanitary, food industry and agriculture for their antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, insecticidal, anticancer, neuroprotective, psychophysiological, and anti-aging activities. Moreover, volatile aroma compounds comprise a chemically diverse class of low molecular weight organic compounds with significant vapor pressure. However, aroma compounds produced by plants, mainly attract pollinators, seed dispersers and provide defense against pests or pathogens. However, in humans, about 300 active olfactory receptor genes are involved to detect thousands of different aroma compounds and modulates expression of different metabolic genes regulating human psychophysiological activity, brain function, pharmacological signaling, and therapeutic potential. Keeping in mind this importance, present database, namely, AromaDb (http://bioinfo.cimap.res.in/aromadb/) covers information of plant varieties/chemotypes, essential oils, chemical constituents, GC-MS profile, yield variations due to agro-morphological parameters, trade data, aroma compounds, fragrance type, and bioactivity details.

The database hosts 1000+ manually curated records of the known 'unknown' regions in the human genome. The new updated version of HypoDB with functionalities (Blast, Match) is freely accessible at http://www.bioclues.org/hypo2.<h4>Methods</h4>The total collection of HPs were checked using experimentally validated sets (from Swiss-Prot) or non-experimentally validated set (TrEMBL) or the complete set (UniProtKB). The database was designed with java at the core backend, integrated with databases, viz. EMBL, PIR, HPRD and those including descriptors for structural databases, interaction and association databases.<h4>Results</h4>The HypoDB constituted Application Programming Interfaces (API) for implicitly searching resources linking them to other databases like NCBI Link-out in addition to multiple search capabilities along with advanced searches using integrated bio-tools, viz.

Therefore, an integral resource of PTM-disease associations (PDAs) would be a great help for both academic research and clinical use. In this work, we reported PTMD, a well-curated database containing PTMs that are associated with human diseases. We manually collected 1950 known PDAs in 749 proteins for 23 types of PTMs and 275 types of diseases from the literature. Database analyses show that phosphorylation has the largest number of disease associations, whereas neurologic diseases have the largest number of PTM associations. We classified all known PDAs into six classes according to the PTM status in diseases and demonstrated that the upregulation and presence of PTM events account for a predominant proportion of disease-associated PTM events. By reconstructing a disease-gene network, we observed that breast cancers have the largest number of associated PTMs and AKT1 has the largest number of PTMs connected to diseases.

From these, relatively few amyloid structures can be identified, since amyloids are insoluble in water. Therefore, most amyloid structures deposited in the PDB are in the form of solid state NMR data. Based on the geometric analysis of these deposited structures, we have prepared an automatically updated web server, which generates a list of the deposited amyloid structures, and also entries of globular proteins that have amyloid-like substructures of given size and characteristics. We have found that by applying only appropriately selected geometric conditions, it is possible to identify deposited amyloid structures and a number of globular proteins with amyloid-like substructures. We have analyzed these globular proteins and have found proof in the literature that many of them form amyloids more easily than many other globular proteins. Our results relate to the method of Stankovic <i>etal</i>. [Stankovic I <i>etal</i>.

We have performed an update of APID database including a redefinition of several key properties of the PPIs to provide a more precise data integration and to avoid false duplicated records. This includes the unification of all the PPIs from five primary databases of molecular interactions (BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, IntAct and MINT), plus the information from two original systematic sources of human data and from experimentally resolved 3D structures (i.e. PDBs, Protein Data Bank files, where more than two distinct proteins have been identified). Thus, APID provides PPIs reported in published research articles (with traceable PMIDs) and detected by valid experimental interaction methods that give evidences about such protein interactions (following the `ontology and controlled vocabulary': www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi; developed by `HUPO PSI-MI'). Within this data mining framework, all interaction detection methods have been grouped into two main types: (i) `binary' physical direct detection methods and (ii) `indirect' methods. As a result of these redefinitions, APID provides unified protein interactomes including the specific `experimental evidences' that support each PPI, indicating whether the interactions can be considered `binary' (i.e. supported by at least one binary detection method) or not.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
30760842,Development and validation of whole genome-wide and genic microsatellite markers in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.): First microsatellite database (OpSatdb).,"The availability of large expressed sequence tag (EST) and whole genome databases of oil palm enabled the development of a data base of microsatellite markers. For this purpose, an EST database consisting of 40,979 EST sequences spanning 27 Mb and a chromosome-wise whole genome databases were downloaded. A total of 3,950 primer pairs were identified and developed from EST sequences. The tri and tetra nucleotide repeat motifs were most prevalent (each 24.75%) followed by di-nucleotide repeat motifs. Whole genome-wide analysis found a total of 245,654 SSR repeats across the 16 chromosomes of oil palm, of which 38,717 were compound microsatellite repeats. A web application, OpSatdb, the first microsatellite database of oil palm, was developed using the PHP and MySQL database ( https://ssr.icar.gov.in/index.php ). It is a simple and systematic web-based search engine for searching SSRs based on repeat motif type, repeat type, and primer details. High synteny was observed between oil palm and rice genomes. The mapping of ESTs having SSRs by Blast2GO resulted in the identification of 19.2% sequences with gene ontology (GO) annotations. Randomly, a set of ten genic SSRs and five genomic SSRs were used for validation and genetic diversity on 100 genotypes belonging to the world oil palm genetic resources. The grouping pattern was observed to be broadly in accordance with the geographical origin of the genotypes. The identified genic and genome-wide SSRs can be effectively useful for various genomic applications of oil palm, such as genetic diversity, linkage map construction, mapping of QTLs, marker-assisted selection, and comparative population studies.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
30994884,Graph-based data integration from bioactive peptide databases of pharmaceutical interest: toward an organized collection enabling visual network analysis.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Bioactive peptides have gained great attention in the academy and pharmaceutical industry since they play an important role in human health. However, the increasing number of bioactive peptide databases is causing the problem of data redundancy and duplicated efforts. Even worse is the fact that the available data is non-standardized and often dirty with data entry errors. Therefore, there is a need for a unified view that enables a more comprehensive analysis of the information on this topic residing at different sites.<h4>Results</h4>After collecting web pages from a large variety of bioactive peptide databases, we organized the web content into an integrated graph database (starPepDB) that holds a total of 71310 nodes and 348505 relationships. In this graph structure, there are 45120 nodes representing peptides, and the rest of the nodes are connected to peptides for describing metadata. Additionally, to facilitate a better understanding of the integrated data, a software tool (starPep toolbox) has been developed for supporting visual network analysis in a user-friendly way; providing several functionalities such as peptide retrieval and filtering, network construction and visualization, interactive exploration and exporting data options.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Both starPepDB and starPep toolbox are freely available at http://mobiosd-hub.com/starpep/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
31016417,DNAmod: the DNA modification database.,"Covalent DNA modifications, such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC), are increasingly the focus of numerous research programs. In eukaryotes, both 5mC and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are now recognized as stable epigenetic marks, with diverse functions. Bacteria, archaea, and viruses contain various other modified DNA nucleobases. Numerous databases describe RNA and histone modifications, but no database specifically catalogues DNA modifications, despite their broad importance in epigenetic regulation. To address this need, we have developed DNAmod: the DNA modification database. DNAmod is an open-source database ( https://dnamod.hoffmanlab.org ) that catalogues DNA modifications and provides a single source to learn about their properties. DNAmod provides a web interface to easily browse and search through these modifications. The database annotates the chemical properties and structures of all curated modified DNA bases, and a much larger list of candidate chemical entities. DNAmod includes manual annotations of available sequencing methods, descriptions of their occurrence in nature, and provides existing and suggested nomenclature. DNAmod enables researchers to rapidly review previous work, select mapping techniques, and track recent developments concerning modified bases of interest.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
31034103,Functional analysis tools for post-translational modification: a post-translational modification database for analysis of proteins and metabolic pathways.,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical regulators of protein function, and nearly 200 different types of PTM have been identified. Advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry have led to the identification of an unprecedented number of PTM sites in numerous organisms, potentially facilitating a more complete understanding of how PTMs regulate cellular behavior. While databases have been created to house the resulting data, most of these resources focus on individual types of PTM, do not consider quantitative PTM analyses or do not provide tools for the visualization and analysis of PTM data. Here, we describe the Functional Analysis Tools for Post-Translational Modifications (FAT-PTM) database (https://bioinformatics.cse.unr.edu/fat-ptm/), which currently supports eight different types of PTM and over 49000 PTM sites identified in large-scale proteomic surveys of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. The FAT-PTM database currently supports tools to visualize protein-centric PTM networks, quantitative phosphorylation site data from over 10 different quantitative phosphoproteomic studies, PTM information displayed in protein-centric metabolic pathways and groups of proteins that are co-modified by multiple PTMs. Overall, the FAT-PTM database provides users with a robust platform to share and visualize experimentally supported PTM data, develop hypotheses related to target proteins or identify emergent patterns in PTM data for signaling and metabolic pathways.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

To enhance the success rate of the research and development (R&D) process in a cost- and time-effective manner, a number of pharmaceutical companies worldwide have made tremendous investments. Besides, many researchers have proposed various methods and databases for the repurposing of various drugs. However, there is not a proper and well-organized database available. To this end, for the first time, we developed a new database based on DrugBank and KEGG data, which is named """"DrugR+"""". Our developed database provides some advantages relative to the DrugBank, and its interface supplies new capabilities for both single and synthetic repositioning of drugs. Moreover, it includes four new datasets which can be used for predicting drug-target interactions using supervised machine learning methods. As a case study, we introduced novel applications of some drugs and discussed the obtained results. A comparison of several machine learning methods on the generated datasets has also been reported in the Supplementary File. Having included several normalized tables, DrugR+has been organized to provide key information on data structures for the repurposing and combining applications of drugs. It provides the SQL query capability for professional users and an appropriate method with different options for unprofessional users. Additionally, DrugR+consists of repurposing service that accepts a drug and proposes a list of potential drugs for some usages.

31284879,ImtRDB: a database and software for mitochondrial imperfect interspersed repeats annotation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mitochondria is a powerhouse of all eukaryotic cells that have its own circular DNA (mtDNA) encoding various RNAs and proteins. Somatic perturbations of mtDNA are accumulating with age thus it is of great importance to uncover the main sources of mtDNA instability. Recent analyses demonstrated that somatic mtDNA deletions depend on imperfect repeats of various nature between distant mtDNA segments. However, till now there are no comprehensive databases annotating all types of imperfect repeats in numerous species with sequenced complete mitochondrial genome as well as there are no algorithms capable to call all types of imperfect repeats in circular mtDNA.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented nave algorithm of pattern recognition by analogy to standard dot-plot construction procedures allowing us to find both perfect and imperfect repeats of four main types: direct, inverted, mirror and complementary. Our algorithm is adapted to specific characteristics of mtDNA such as circularity and an excess of short repeats - it calls imperfect repeats starting from the length of 10 b.p. We constructed interactive web available database ImtRDB depositing perfect and imperfect repeats positions in mtDNAs of more than 3500 Vertebrate species. Additional tools, such as visualization of repeats within a genome, comparison of repeat densities among different genomes and a possibility to download all results make this database useful for many biologists. Our first analyses of the database demonstrated that mtDNA imperfect repeats (i) are usually short; (ii) associated with unfolded DNA structures; (iii) four types of repeats positively correlate with each other forming two equivalent pairs: direct and mirror versus inverted and complementary, with identical nucleotide content and similar distribution between species; (iv) abundance of repeats is negatively associated with GC content; (v) dinucleotides GC versus CG are overrepresented on light chain of mtDNA covered by repeats.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ImtRDB is available at http://bioinfodbs.kantiana.ru/ImtRDB/ . It is accompanied by the software calling all types of interspersed repeats with different level of degeneracy in circular DNA. This database and software can become a very useful tool in various areas of mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA research.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
31416842,Curatopes Melanoma: A Database of Predicted T-cell Epitopes from Overly Expressed Proteins in Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma.,"Therapeutic anticancer vaccination has been adapted as an immunotherapy in several solid tumors. However, the selection of promising candidates from the total quantity of possible epitopes poses a challenge to clinicians and bioinformaticians alike, and very few epitopes have been tested in experimental or clinical settings to validate their efficacy. Here, we present a comprehensive database of predicted nonmutated peptide epitopes derived from genes that are overly expressed in a group of 32 melanoma biopsies compared with healthy tissues and that were filtered against expression in a curated list of survival-critical tissues. We hypothesize that these """"self-tolerant"""" epitopes have two desirable properties: they do not depend on mutations, being immediately applicable to a large patient collective, and they potentially cause fewer autoimmune reactions. To support epitope selection, we provide an aggregated score of expected therapeutic efficiency as a shortlist mechanism. The database has applications in facilitating epitope selection and trial design and is freely accessible at https://www.curatopes.com. SIGNIFICANCE: A database is presented that predicts and scores antitumor T-cell epitopes, with a focus on tolerability and avoidance of severe autoimmunity, offering a supplementary epitope set for further investigation in immunotherapy.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
31490686,TMB Library of Nucleosome Simulations.,"Nucleosomes are the fundamental building blocks of chromatin, the biomaterial that houses the genome in all higher organisms. A nucleosome consists of 145-147 base pairs of DNA wrapped 1.7 times around eight histones. Given a four-letter code (A, C, G, T), there are approximately 4147 or 1088 oligonucleotides that can form a nucleosome. Comparative, rather than comprehensive, studies are required. Here we introduce the TMB Library of nucleosome simulations and present a meta-analysis of over 20 s of all atom molecular dynamics simulations representing 518 different realizations of the nucleosome. The TMB Library serves as a reference for future comparative, on-demand simulations of nucleosomes and a demonstration of iBIOMES Lite as a tool for managing a laboratory's simulation library. For every simulation, dewatered trajectories, RMSD, and DNA helical parameter data are provided through iBIOMES Lite in a Web browser and a file browser format. A novel view of nucleosomal DNA emerges from our meta-analysis of the TMB Library. DNA conformation is restricted to a specific left-handed superhelix, but the range of conformations observed for individual bases and base pairs is not more restricted nor more highly deformed than DNA free in solution. With the exception of Roll, mean DNA helical parameter values obtained from simulations of nucleosomes are largely within the range of thermal motion of DNA free in solution. The library provides evidence of DNA kinking in the nucleosome and clearly demonstrates the effects of DNA sequence on the gross structure and dynamics of nucleosomes. These effects and mispositioning of the 601 super strong nucleosome positioning sequence can be detected in short simulations (10 ns). Collectively, the results provide a basis for comparative simulation studies of nucleosomes and extend our understanding of the binding of proteins and drugs to nucleosomal DNA.

To better understand the full spectrum of the genetic contribution to human disease, concerted efforts are needed to construct a useful modifier resource for interpreting the information from sequencing data. Here, we present the PhenoModifier (https://www.biosino.org/PhenoModifier), a manually curated database that provides a comprehensive overview of human genetic modifiers. By manually curating over ten thousand published articles, 3078 records of modifier information were entered into the current version of PhenoModifier, related to 288 different disorders, 2126 genetic modifier variants and 843 distinct modifier genes. To help users probe further into the mechanism of their interested modifier genes, we extended the yeast genetic interaction data and yeast quantitative trait loci to the human and we also integrated GWAS data into the PhenoModifier to assist users in evaluating all possible phenotypes associated with a modifier allele. As the first comprehensive resource of human genetic modifiers, PhenoModifier provides a more complete spectrum of genetic factors contributing to human phenotypic variation.

High heterozygosity combined with a long gestational period makes conventional breeding a cumbersome process. Therefore, marker-assisted breeding is a better alternative approach when compared with conventional breeding. Considering the large genome size of tea (~3Gb), information about simple sequence repeat (SSR) is scanty. Thus, we have taken advantage of the recently published tea genomes to identify large numbers of SSR markers in the tea. Besides the genomic sequences, we identified SSRs from the other publicly available sequences such as RNA-seq, GSS, ESTs and organelle genomes (chloroplasts and mitochondrial) and also searched published literature to catalog validated set of tea SSR markers. The complete exercise yielded a total of 935 547 SSRs. Out of the total, 82 SSRs were selected for validation among a diverse set of tea genotypes. Six primers (each with four to six alleles, an average of five alleles per locus) out of the total 27 polymorphic primers were used for a diversity analysis in 36 tea genotypes with mean polymorphic information content of 0.61-0.76. Finally, using all the information generated in this study, we have developed a user-friendly database (TeaMiD; http://indianteagenome.in:8080/teamid/) that hosts SSR from all the six resources including three nuclear genomes of tea and transcriptome sequences of 17 Camellia wild species.

32277449,Choice of the Promoter for Tissue and Developmental Stage-Specific Gene Expression.,"Transgenic technologies belong to important tools of reverse genetics and biotechnology in plants. Targeted genetic modifications can reveal functions of genes of interest, change metabolic and regulatory pathways, or result in accumulation of valuable proteins or metabolites. However, to be efficient in targeted genetic modification, the chimeric gene construct should be designed properly. In particular, the promoters used to control transgene expression need to be carefully chosen. Most promoters in widely used vectors belong to strong and constitutively expressed variants. However, in many cases transgene expression has to be restricted to certain tissue, stage of development, or response to some internal or external stimuli. In turn, a large variety of tissue-specific promoters have been studied and information on their characteristics may be recovered from the literature. An appropriate promoter may be selected and used in genetic construct to optimize the transgene transcription pattern. We have previously designed the TGP database (TransGene Promoters, http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/dbases/tgp/home.html ) collecting information from the publications in this field.

In a way of plant adaptation, plant hormones have been evolved to efficiently use limited resources. Plant hormones including auxin, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene have been studied to reveal their role in plant adaptation against their environment by phenotypic observation with experimental design such as mutation on hormone receptors and treatment / non-treatment of plant hormones along with other environmental conditions. With the development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, it became possible to score the total gene expression of the sampled plants and estimate the degree of effect of plant hormones in gene expression. This allowed us to infer the signaling pathway through plant hormones, which greatly stimulated the study of functional genomics using mutants. Due to the continued development of NGS technology and analytical techniques, many plant hormone-related studies have produced and accumulated NGS-based data, especially RNAseq data have been stored in the sequence read archive represented by NCBI, EBI, and DDBJ.<h4>Description</h4>Here, hormone treatment RNAseq data of Arabidopsis (Col0), wild-type genotype, were collected with mock, SA, and MeJA treatments. The genes affected by hormones were identified through a machine learning approach. The degree of expression of the affected gene was quantified, visualized in boxplot using d3 (data-driven-document), and the database was built by Django.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using this database, we created a web application ( http://pgl.gnu.ac.kr/hormoneDB/ ) that lists hormone-related or hormone-affected genes and visualizes the boxplot of the gene expression of selected genes. This web application eventually aids the functional genomics researchers who want to gather the cases of the gene responses by the hormones.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

To facilitate community-based annotation and mining of the rapidly accumulating functional genomics resources, we have initiated an international consortium and present a comprehensive multi-omics resource database named Nannochloropsis Design and Synthesis (NanDeSyn; http://nandesyn.single-cell.cn). Via the Tripal toolkit, it features user-friendly interfaces hosting genomic resources with gene annotations and transcriptomic and proteomic data for six Nannochloropsis species, including two updated genomes of Nannochloropsis oceanica IMET1 and Nannochloropsis salina CCMP1776. Toolboxes for search, Blast, synteny view, enrichment analysis, metabolic pathway analysis, a genome browser, etc. are also included. In addition, functional validation of genes is indicated based on phenotypes of mutants and relevant bibliography. Furthermore, epigenomic resources are also incorporated, especially for sequencing of small RNAs including microRNAs and circular RNAs. Such comprehensive and integrated landscapes of Nannochloropsis genomics and epigenomics will promote and accelerate community efforts in systems and synthetic biology of these industrially important microalgae.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33137185,iCSDB: an integrated database of CRISPR screens.,"High-throughput screening based on CRISPR-Cas9 libraries has become an attractive and powerful technique to identify target genes for functional studies. However, accessibility of public data is limited due to the lack of user-friendly utilities and up-to-date resources covering experiments from third parties. Here, we describe iCSDB, an integrated database of CRISPR screening experiments using human cell lines. We compiled two major sources of CRISPR-Cas9 screening: the DepMap portal and BioGRID ORCS. DepMap portal itself is an integrated database that includes three large-scale projects of CRISPR screening. We additionally aggregated CRISPR screens from BioGRID ORCS that is a collection of screening results from PubMed articles. Currently, iCSDB contains 1375 genome-wide screens across 976 human cell lines, covering 28 tissues and 70 cancer types. Importantly, the batch effects from different CRISPR libraries were removed and the screening scores were converted into a single metric to estimate the knockout efficiency. Clinical and molecular information were also integrated to help users to select cell lines of interest readily. Furthermore, we have implemented various interactive tools and viewers to facilitate users to choose, examine and compare the screen results both at the gene and guide RNA levels. iCSDB is available at https://www.kobic.re.kr/icsdb/.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,
33166383,FireProtDB: database of manually curated protein stability data.,"The majority of naturally occurring proteins have evolved to function under mild conditions inside the living organisms. One of the critical obstacles for the use of proteins in biotechnological applications is their insufficient stability at elevated temperatures or in the presence of salts. Since experimental screening for stabilizing mutations is typically laborious and expensive, in silico predictors are often used for narrowing down the mutational landscape. The recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence further facilitate the development of such computational tools. However, the accuracy of these predictors strongly depends on the quality and amount of data used for training and testing, which have often been reported as the current bottleneck of the approach. To address this problem, we present a novel database of experimental thermostability data for single-point mutants FireProtDB. The database combines the published datasets, data extracted manually from the recent literature, and the data collected in our laboratory. Its user interface is designed to facilitate both types of the expected use: (i) the interactive explorations of individual entries on the level of a protein or mutation and (ii) the construction of highly customized and machine learning-friendly datasets using advanced searching and filtering.

PSORTdb comprises ePSORTdb, a manually curated database of experimentally verified protein SCLs, and cPSORTdb, a pre-computed database of PSORTb-predicted SCLs for NCBI's RefSeq deduced bacterial and archaeal proteomes. We now report PSORTdb 4.0 (http://db.psort.org/). It features a website refresh, in particular a more user-friendly database search. It also addresses the need to uniquely identify proteins from NCBI genomes now that GI numbers have been retired. It further expands both ePSORTdb and cPSORTdb, including additional data about novel secondary localizations, such as proteins found in bacterial outer membrane vesicles. Protein predictions in cPSORTdb have increased along with the number of available microbial genomes, from approximately 13 million when PSORTdb 3.0 was released, to over 66 million currently. Now, analyses of both complete and draft genomes are included.

Each entry in the database contains relevant background information on how the data was compiled as well as the total energy of each molecular system and interfragment interaction energy (IFIE) and pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) values. Currently, the database contains more than 13600 FMO calculation data sets, and a comprehensive search function implemented at the front-end. The procedure for selecting target proteins, preprocessing the experimental structures, construction of the database, and details of the database front-end were described. Then, we demonstrated a use of the FMODB by comparing IFIE value distributions of hydrogen bond, ion-pair, and XH/p interactions obtained by FMO method to those by molecular mechanics approach. From the comparison, the statistical analysis of the data provided standard reference values for the three types of interactions that will be useful for determining whether each interaction in a given system is relatively strong or weak compared to the interactions contained within the data in the FMODB. In the final part, we demonstrate the use of the database to examine the contribution of halogen atoms to the binding affinity between human cathepsin L and its inhibitors. We found that the electrostatic term derived by PIEDA greatly correlated with the binding affinities of the halogen containing cathepsin L inhibitors, indicating the importance of QM calculation for quantitative analysis of halogen interactions. Thus, the FMO calculation data in FMODB will be useful for conducting statistical analyses to drug discovery, for conducting molecular recognition studies in structural biology, and for other studies involving quantum mechanics-based interactions.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

A wealth of information about drug and small molecule structure, targets, indications and side effects; induced gene expression signatures; and other attributes are publicly available through web-based tools, databases and repositories. By processing, abstracting and aggregating information from these resources into drug set libraries, knowledge about novel properties of drugs and small molecules can be systematically imputed with machine learning. In addition, drug set libraries can be used as the underlying database for drug set enrichment analysis. Here, we present Drugmonizome, a database with a search engine for querying annotated sets of drugs and small molecules for performing drug set enrichment analysis. Utilizing the data within Drugmonizome, we also developed Drugmonizome-ML. Drugmonizome-ML enables users to construct customized machine learning pipelines using the drug set libraries from Drugmonizome. To demonstrate the utility of Drugmonizome, drug sets from 12 independent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro screens were subjected to consensus enrichment analysis. Despite the low overlap among these 12 independent in vitro screens, we identified common biological processes critical for blocking viral replication. To demonstrate Drugmonizome-ML, we constructed a machine learning pipeline to predict whether approved and preclinical drugs may induce peripheral neuropathy as a potential side effect. Overall, the Drugmonizome and Drugmonizome-ML resources provide rich and diverse knowledge about drugs and small molecules for direct systems pharmacology applications.

Due to the diverse chemical compounds, various mass spectrometry (MS) setups with state-of-the-art technologies have been used. Over the past two decades, we have analyzed various biological samples by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, or capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry, and archived the datasets in the depository MassBase (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/massbase/). As the format of MS datasets depends on the MS setup used, we converted each raw binary dataset of the mass chromatogram to text file format, and thereafter, information of the chromatograph peak was extracted in the text file from the converted file.

IND601142821,MulSatDB: a first online database for mulberry microsatellites,"KEY MESSAGE : Simple sequence repeat motifs were mined from the genome and EST sequences of Morus notabilis and archived in MulSatDB. Bioinformatics tools were integrated with the database for the analysis of genomic datasets. Mulberry is a crop of economic importance in sericulture, which shapes the lives of millions of rural people among different Eurasian and Latin American countries. Limited availability of genomic resources has constrained the molecular breeding efforts in mulberry, a poorly studied crop. Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) has revolutionized the plant breeding and is used in linkage mapping, association studies, diversity, and parentage analysis, etc. Recent availability of mulberry whole genome assembly provided an opportunity for the development of mulberry-specific DNA markers. In this study, we mined a total of 217,312 microsatellites from whole genome and 961 microsatellites from EST sequences of Morus notabilis. Mono-repeats were predominant among both whole genome and EST sequences. The SSR containing EST sequences were functionally annotated, and SSRs mined from whole genome were mapped on chromosomes of the phylogenetically related genusFragaria vesca, to aid the selection of markers based on the function and location. All the mined markers were archived in the mulberry microsatellite database (MulSatDB), and the markers can be retrieved based on different criteria like marker location, repeat kind, motif type and size. Primer3plus and CMap tools are integrated with the database to design primers for PCR amplification and to visualize markers on F. vesca chromosomes, respectively. A blast tool is also integrated to collate new markers with the database.

These so-called N-fixing plants are widely used for reclamation of disturbed vegetation and improvement of soil fertility in agroforestry. Yet, available information about plants that are capable of establishing nodulation is fragmented and somewhat outdated. This article introduces the NodDB database of N-fixing plants based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence (available at https://doi.org/10.15156/bio/587469) and discusses plant groups with conflicting reports and interpretation, such as certain legume clades and the Zygophyllaceae family. During angiosperm evolution, N-fixing plants became common in the fabid rather than in the nitrogen-fixing clade. The global GBIF plant species distribution data indicated that N-fixing plants tend to be relatively more diverse in savanna and semi-desert biomes. The compiled and re-interpreted information about N-fixing plants enables accurate analyses of biogeography and community ecology of biological N fixation.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1,,

Considerable effort is ongoing to automate this greatly labor-intensive and currently rate-determining process. Experimental data in the form of manually traced digital reconstructions and corresponding image stacks play a vital role in developing increasingly more powerful reconstruction algorithms.

The original research projects that provided these data are representative of the diverse scientific questions addressed in this field. At the same time, these data provide a benchmark for the types of demands automated software must meet to achieve the quality of manual reconstructions while minimizing human involvement. The DIADEM data underwent extensive curation, including quality control, metadata annotation, and format standardization, to focus the challenge on the most substantial technical obstacles.

Coffea arabica and C. canephora are responsible for 70 and 30% of commercial production, respectively. C. arabica is an allotetraploid from a recent hybridization of the diploid species, C. canephora and C. eugenioides. C. arabica has lower genetic diversity and results in a higher quality beverage than C. canephora. Research initiatives have been launched to produce genomic and transcriptomic data about Coffea spp. as a strategy to improve breeding efficiency.<h4>Results</h4>Assembling the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of C. arabica and C. canephora produced by the Brazilian Coffee Genome Project and the Nestl-Cornell Consortium revealed 32,007 clusters of C. arabica and 16,665 clusters of C. canephora. We detected different GC3 profiles between these species that are related to their genome structure and mating system. BLAST analysis revealed similarities between coffee and grape (Vitis vinifera) genes. Using KA/KS analysis, we identified coffee genes under purifying and positive selection. Protein domain and gene ontology analyses suggested differences between Coffea spp. data, mainly in relation to complex sugar synthases and nucleotide binding proteins. OrthoMCL was used to identify specific and prevalent coffee protein families when compared to five other plant species. Among the interesting families annotated are new cystatins, glycine-rich proteins and RALF-like peptides. Hierarchical clustering was used to independently group C. arabica and C. canephora expression clusters according to expression data extracted from EST libraries, resulting in the identification of differentially expressed genes. Based on these results, we emphasize gene annotation and discuss plant defenses, abiotic stress and cup quality-related functional categories.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We present the first comprehensive genome-wide transcript profile study of C. arabica and C. canephora, which can be freely assessed by the scientific community at http://www.lge.ibi.unicamp.br/coffea. Our data reveal the presence of species-specific/prevalent genes in coffee that may help to explain particular characteristics of these two crops. The identification of differentially expressed transcripts offers a starting point for the correlation between gene expression profiles and Coffea spp. developmental traits, providing valuable insights for coffee breeding and biotechnology, especially concerning sugar metabolism and stress tolerance.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,iffy - project website but aggregated and value add… looks like it'd be in risk if the data aren't elsewhere

21411447,Using computational predictions to improve literature-based Gene Ontology annotations: a feasibility study.,"Annotation using Gene Ontology (GO) terms is one of the most important ways in which biological information about specific gene products can be expressed in a searchable, computable form that may be compared across genomes and organisms. Because literature-based GO annotations are often used to propagate functional predictions between related proteins, their accuracy is critically important. We present a strategy that employs a comparison of literature-based annotations with computational predictions to identify and prioritize genes whose annotations need review. Using this method, we show that comparison of manually assigned 'unknown' annotations in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) with InterPro-based predictions can identify annotations that need to be updated. A survey of literature-based annotations and computational predictions made by the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) project at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) across several other databases shows that this comparison strategy could be used to maintain and improve the quality of GO annotations for other organisms besides yeast. The survey also shows that although GOA-assigned predictions are the most comprehensive source of functional information for many genomes, a large proportion of genes in a variety of different organisms entirely lack these predictions but do have manual annotations. This underscores the critical need for manually performed, literature-based curation to provide functional information about genes that are outside the scope of widely used computational methods. Thus, the combination of manual and computational methods is essential to provide the most accurate and complete functional annotation of a genome.

The non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), lead to amino acid changes in the protein product may account for nearly half of the known genetic variations linked to inherited human diseases and cancer. One of the main problems of medical genetics today is to identify nsSNPs that underlie disease-related phenotypes in humans. An attempt was made to develop a new approach to predict such nsSNPs. This would enhance our understanding of genetic diseases and helps to predict the disease. We detect nsSNPs and all possible and reliable alleles by ANN, a soft computing model using potential SNP information. Reliable nsSNPs are identified, based on the reconstructed alleles and on sequence redundancy. The model gives good results with mean specificity (95.85&), sensitivity (97.40&) and accuracy (96.25&). Our results indicate that ANNs can serve as a useful method to analyze quantitative effect of nsSNPs on protein function and would be useful for large-scale analysis of genomic nsSNP data.<h4>Availability</h4>The database is available for free at http://www.snp.mirworks.in.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
21523935,ncRNA consensus secondary structure derivation using grammar strings.,"Many noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) function through both their sequences and secondary structures. Thus, secondary structure derivation is an important issue in today's RNA research. The state-of-the-art structure annotation tools are based on comparative analysis, which derives consensus structure of homologous ncRNAs. Despite promising results from existing ncRNA aligning and consensus structure derivation tools, there is a need for more efficient and accurate ncRNA secondary structure modeling and alignment methods. In this work, we introduce a consensus structure derivation approach based on grammar string, a novel ncRNA secondary structure representation that encodes an ncRNA's sequence and secondary structure in the parameter space of a context-free grammar (CFG) and a full RNA grammar including pseudoknots. Being a string defined on a special alphabet constructed from a grammar, grammar string converts ncRNA alignment into sequence alignment. We derive consensus secondary structures from hundreds of ncRNA families from BraliBase 2.1 and 25 families containing pseudoknots using grammar string alignment. Our experiments have shown that grammar string-based structure derivation competes favorably in consensus structure quality with Murlet and RNASampler.

Many different experimental techniques have been applied to analyse the effects of dosage imbalance at the molecular and phenotypical level, however, currently no integrative approach exists that attempts to extract the common information.<h4>Results</h4>We have performed a statistical meta-analysis from 45 heterogeneous publicly available DS data sets in order to identify consistent dosage effects from these studies. We identified 324 genes with significant genome-wide dosage effects, including well investigated genes like SOD1, APP, RUNX1 and DYRK1A as well as a large proportion of novel genes (N = 62). Furthermore, we characterized these genes using gene ontology, molecular interactions and promoter sequence analysis. In order to judge relevance of the 324 genes for more general cerebral pathologies we used independent publicly available microarry data from brain studies not related with DS and identified a subset of 79 genes with potential impact for neurocognitive processes. All results have been made available through a web server under http://ds-geneminer.molgen.mpg.de/.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study represents a comprehensive integrative analysis of heterogeneous data including genome-wide transcript levels in the domain of trisomy 21.

The information gathered was processed and an electronic toxicology database (http://www.inct-ta.furg.br/bd_toxicologico.php) was generated. This database provides valuable information for researchers to select sensitive and tolerant aquatic species to a large variety of aquatic pollutants. Furthermore, the toxicology database allows researchers to select species representative of an ecosystem of interest. Analysis of the toxicology database showed that ecotoxicological assays have significantly improved in Brazil over the last decade, in spite of the still relatively low number of tests performed and the restricted number of native species tested. This is because most of the research is developed in a few laboratories concentrated in certain regions of Brazil, especially in Southern and Southeast regions. Considering the extremely rich biodiversity and the large variety of aquatic ecosystems in Brazil, this finding points to the urgent need for the development of ecotoxicological studies with other groups of aquatic animals, such as insects, foraminifera, cnidarians, worms, amphibians, among others. This would help to derive more realistic water quality criteria (WQC) values, which would better protect the different aquatic ecosystems in Brazil. Finally, the toxicology database generated presents solid and science based information, which can encourage and drive the Environmental Regulatory Agencies in Brazil to derive WQC based on native species. In this context, the present paper discusses the historical evolution of ecotoxicological studies in Brazil, and how they have contributed to the improvement of the Brazilian Federal and Regional regulations for environment.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

To provide a framework for this assembly, it would be a great advantage to have a dense map of the tammar wallaby genome. However, only limited mapping data are available for this non-model species, comprising a physical map and a linkage map.<h4>Results</h4>We combined all available tammar wallaby mapping data to create a tammar wallaby integrated map, using the Location DataBase (LDB) strategy. This first-generation integrated map combines all available information from the second-generation tammar wallaby linkage map with 148 loci, and extensive FISH mapping data for 492 loci, especially for genes likely to be located at the ends of wallaby chromosomes or at evolutionary breakpoints inferred from comparative information. For loci whose positions are only approximately known, their location in the integrated map was refined on the basis of comparative information from opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and human. Interpolation of segments from the opossum and human assemblies into the integrated map enabled the subsequent construction of a tammar wallaby first-generation virtual genome map, which comprises 14336 markers, including 13783 genes recruited from opossum and human assemblies. Both maps are freely available at http://compldb.angis.org.au.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The first-generation integrated map and the first-generation virtual genome map provide a backbone for the chromosome assembly of the tammar wallaby genome sequence. For example, 78% of the 10257 gene-scaffolds in the Ensembl annotation of the tammar wallaby genome sequence (including 10522 protein-coding genes) can now be given a chromosome location in the tammar wallaby virtual genome map.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,"iffy - data from elsewhere, but integrated, may count then, but not available so will fall out later"
21880147,An integrative approach to ortholog prediction for disease-focused and other functional studies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mapping of orthologous genes among species serves an important role in functional genomics by allowing researchers to develop hypotheses about gene function in one species based on what is known about the functions of orthologs in other species. Several tools for predicting orthologous gene relationships are available. However, these tools can give different results and identification of predicted orthologs is not always straightforward.<h4>Results</h4>We report a simple but effective tool, the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt), for rapid identification of orthologs. DIOPT integrates existing approaches, facilitating rapid identification of orthologs among human, mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans, Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae. As compared to individual tools, DIOPT shows increased sensitivity with only a modest decrease in specificity. Moreover, the flexibility built into the DIOPT graphical user interface allows researchers with different goals to appropriately 'cast a wide net' or limit results to highest confidence predictions. DIOPT also displays protein and domain alignments, including percent amino acid identity, for predicted ortholog pairs. This helps users identify the most appropriate matches among multiple possible orthologs. To facilitate using model organisms for functional analysis of human disease-associated genes, we used DIOPT to predict high-confidence orthologs of disease genes in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and genes in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets. The results are accessible through the DIOPT diseases and traits query tool (DIOPT-DIST; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt-dist).<h4>Conclusions</h4>DIOPT and DIOPT-DIST are useful resources for researchers working with model organisms, especially those who are interested in exploiting model organisms such as Drosophila to study the functions of human disease genes.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
21929785,The representation of protein complexes in the Protein Ontology (PRO).,"<h4>Background</h4>Representing species-specific proteins and protein complexes in ontologies that are both human- and machine-readable facilitates the retrieval, analysis, and interpretation of genome-scale data sets. Although existing protin-centric informatics resources provide the biomedical research community with well-curated compendia of protein sequence and structure, these resources lack formal ontological representations of the relationships among the proteins themselves. The Protein Ontology (PRO) Consortium is filling this informatics resource gap by developing ontological representations and relationships among proteins and their variants and modified forms. Because proteins are often functional only as members of stable protein complexes, the PRO Consortium, in collaboration with existing protein and pathway databases, has launched a new initiative to implement logical and consistent representation of protein complexes.<h4>Description</h4>We describe here how the PRO Consortium is meeting the challenge of representing species-specific protein complexes, how protein complex representation in PRO supports annotation of protein complexes and comparative biology, and how PRO is being integrated into existing community bioinformatics resources. The PRO resource is accessible at http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro/.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PRO is a unique database resource for species-specific protein complexes. PRO facilitates robust annotation of variations in composition and function contexts for protein complexes within and between species.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Given the high divergence of reptiles from classical model species, next-generation sequencing of their transcriptomes is an approach of choice for gene identification and annotation.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we use 454 technology to sequence the brain transcriptome of four divergent reptilian and one reference avian species: the Nile crocodile, the corn snake, the bearded dragon, the red-eared turtle, and the chicken. Using an in-house pipeline for recursive similarity searches of >3,000,000 reads against multiple databases from 7 reference vertebrates, we compile a reptilian comparative transcriptomics dataset, with homology assignment for 20,000 to 31,000 transcripts per species and a cumulated non-redundant sequence length of 248.6 Mbases. Our approach identifies the majority (87%) of chicken brain transcripts and about 50% of de novo assembled reptilian transcripts. In addition to 57,502 microsatellite loci, we identify thousands of SNP and indel polymorphisms for population genetic and linkage analyses. We also build very large multiple alignments for Sauropsida and mammals (two million residues per species) and perform extensive phylogenetic analyses suggesting that turtles are not basal living reptiles but are rather associated with Archosaurians, hence, potentially answering a long-standing question in the phylogeny of Amniotes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reptilian transcriptome (freely available at http://www.reptilian-transcriptomes.org) should prove a useful new resource as reptiles are becoming important new models for comparative genomics, ecology, and evolutionary developmental genetics.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
21994220,FlyExpress: visual mining of spatiotemporal patterns for genes and publications in Drosophila embryogenesis.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Images containing spatial expression patterns illuminate the roles of different genes during embryogenesis. In order to generate initial clues to regulatory interactions, biologists frequently need to know the set of genes expressed at the same time at specific locations in a developing embryo, as well as related research publications. However, text-based mining of image annotations and research articles cannot produce all relevant results, because the primary data are images that exist as graphical objects. We have developed a unique knowledge base (FlyExpress) to facilitate visual mining of images from Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis. By clicking on specific locations in pictures of fly embryos from different stages of development and different visual projections, users can produce a list of genes and publications instantly. In FlyExpress, each queryable embryo picture is a heat-map that captures the expression patterns of more than 4500 genes and more than 2600 published articles. In addition, one can view spatial patterns for particular genes over time as well as find other genes with similar expression patterns at a given developmental stage. Therefore, FlyExpress is a unique tool for mining spatiotemporal expression patterns in a format readily accessible to the scientific community.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.flyexpress.net<h4>Contact</h4>s.kumar@asu.edu.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
22102885,"Novel SSR markers from BAC-end sequences, DArT arrays and a comprehensive genetic map with 1,291 marker loci for chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.).","Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the third most important cool season food legume, cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. The goal of this study was to develop novel molecular markers such as microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-end sequences (BESs) and diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers, and to construct a high-density genetic map based on recombinant inbred line (RIL) population ICC 4958 (C. arietinum)PI 489777 (C. reticulatum). A BAC-library comprising 55,680 clones was constructed and 46,270 BESs were generated. Mining of these BESs provided 6,845 SSRs, and primer pairs were designed for 1,344 SSRs. In parallel, DArT arrays with ca. 15,000 clones were developed, and 5,397 clones were found polymorphic among 94 genotypes tested. Screening of newly developed BES-SSR markers and DArT arrays on the parental genotypes of the RIL mapping population showed polymorphism with 253 BES-SSR markers and 675 DArT markers. Segregation data obtained for these polymorphic markers and 494 markers data compiled from published reports or collaborators were used for constructing the genetic map. As a result, a comprehensive genetic map comprising 1,291 markers on eight linkage groups (LGs) spanning a total of 845.56 cM distance was developed (http://cmap.icrisat.ac.in/cmap/sm/cp/thudi/). The number of markers per linkage group ranged from 68 (LG 8) to 218 (LG 3) with an average inter-marker distance of 0.65 cM. While the developed resource of molecular markers will be useful for genetic diversity, genetic mapping and molecular breeding applications, the comprehensive genetic map with integrated BES-SSR markers will facilitate its anchoring to the physical map (under construction) to accelerate map-based cloning of genes in chickpea and comparative genome evolution studies in legumes.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Its genetic improvement is essential to provide protection against major diseases and improve chocolate quality. We discovered and mapped new expressed sequence tag-single nucleotide polymorphism (EST-SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and constructed a high-density genetic map. By screening 149 650 ESTs, 5246 SNPs were detected in silico, of which 1536 corresponded to genes with a putative function, while 851 had a clear polymorphic pattern across a collection of genetic resources. In addition, 409 new SSR markers were detected on the Criollo genome. Lastly, 681 new EST-SNPs and 163 new SSRs were added to the pre-existing 418 co-dominant markers to construct a large consensus genetic map. This high-density map and the set of new genetic markers identified in this study are a milestone in cocoa genomics and for marker-assisted breeding.

22303453,Catalog of microRNA seed polymorphisms in vertebrates.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNA that plays an important role in posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA. Evidence has shown that miRNA gene variability might interfere with its function resulting in phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility. A major role in miRNA target recognition is ascribed to complementarity with the miRNA seed region that can be affected by polymorphisms. In the present study, we developed an online tool for the detection of miRNA polymorphisms (miRNA SNiPer) in vertebrates (http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-SNiPer) and generated a catalog of miRNA seed region polymorphisms (miR-seed-SNPs) consisting of 149 SNPs in six species. Although a majority of detected polymorphisms were due to point mutations, two consecutive nucleotide substitutions (double nucleotide polymorphisms, DNPs) were also identified in nine miRNAs. We determined that miR-SNPs are frequently located within the quantitative trait loci (QTL), chromosome fragile sites, and cancer susceptibility loci, indicating their potential role in the genetic control of various complex traits. To test this further, we performed an association analysis between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP rs30372501, which is polymorphic in a large number of standard inbred strains, and all phenotypic traits in these strains deposited in the Mouse Phenome Database. Analysis showed a significant association between the mmu-miR-717 seed SNP and a diverse array of traits including behavior, blood-clinical chemistry, body weight size and growth, and immune system suggesting that seed SNPs can indeed have major pleiotropic effects. The bioinformatics analyses, data and tools developed in the present study can serve researchers as a starting point in testing more targeted hypotheses and designing experiments using optimal species or strains for further mechanistic studies.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
22440904,Quantitative proteomics identifies vasopressin-responsive nuclear proteins in collecting duct cells.,"Vasopressin controls transport in the renal collecting duct, in part, by regulating transcription. This complex process, which can involve translocation and/or modification of transcriptional regulators, is not completely understood. Here, we applied a method for large-scale profiling of nuclear proteins to quantify vasopressin-induced changes in the nuclear proteome of cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD) cells. Using stable isotope labeling and tandem mass spectrometry, we quantified 3987 nuclear proteins and identified significant changes in the abundance of 65, including previously established targets of vasopressin signaling in the collecting duct. Vasopressin-induced changes in the abundance of the transcription factors JunB, Elf3, Gatad2b, and Hmbox1; transcriptional co-regulators Ctnnb1 (-catenin) and Crebbp; subunits of the Mediator complex; E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4; nuclear transport regulator RanGap1; and several proteins associated with tight junctions and adherens junctions. Bioinformatic analysis showed that many of the quantified transcription factors have putative binding sites in the 5'-flanking regions of genes coding for the channel proteins Aqp2, Aqp3, Scnn1b (ENaC), and Scnn1g (ENaC<U+03B3>), which are known targets of vasopressin. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the increase in -catenin in nuclear fractions was accompanied by an even larger increase in its phosphorylated form (pSer552). The findings provide a new online database resource for nuclear proteomics (http://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/mNPD/) and generate new hypotheses regarding vasopressin-mediated transcriptional regulation in the collecting duct.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V-SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies.

Cscan is a web resource that includes a large collection of genome-wide ChIP-Seq experiments performed on TFs, histone modifications, RNA polymerases and others. Enriched peak regions from the ChIP-Seq experiments are crossed with the genomic coordinates of a set of input genes, to identify which of the experiments present a statistically significant number of peaks within the input genes' loci. The input can be a cluster of co-expressed genes, or any other set of genes sharing a common regulatory profile. Users can thus single out which TFs are likely to be common regulators of the genes, and their respective correlations. Also, by examining results on promoter activation, transcription, histone modifications, polymerase binding and so on, users can investigate the effect of the TFs (activation or repression of transcription) as well as of the cell or tissue specificity of the genes' regulation and expression.

22759420,Comparative evaluation of set-level techniques in predictive classification of gene expression samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>Analysis of gene expression data in terms of a priori-defined gene sets has recently received significant attention as this approach typically yields more compact and interpretable results than those produced by traditional methods that rely on individual genes. The set-level strategy can also be adopted with similar benefits in predictive classification tasks accomplished with machine learning algorithms. Initial studies into the predictive performance of set-level classifiers have yielded rather controversial results. The goal of this study is to provide a more conclusive evaluation by testing various components of the set-level framework within a large collection of machine learning experiments.<h4>Results</h4>Genuine curated gene sets constitute better features for classification than sets assembled without biological relevance. For identifying the best gene sets for classification, the Global test outperforms the gene-set methods GSEA and SAM-GS as well as two generic feature selection methods. To aggregate expressions of genes into a feature value, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method as well as the SetSig technique improve on simple arithmetic averaging. Set-level classifiers learned with 10 features constituted by the Global test slightly outperform baseline gene-level classifiers learned with all original data features although they are slightly less accurate than gene-level classifiers learned with a prior feature-selection step.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Set-level classifiers do not boost predictive accuracy, however, they do achieve competitive accuracy if learned with the right combination of ingredients.<h4>Availability</h4>Open-source, publicly available software was used for classifier learning and testing.

The 3D structures of complex proteins are reliable source of domain-domain interaction (DDI) but the number of proven structures is very limited. Several resources for the computationally predicted DDI have been generated but they are scattered in various places and their prediction show erratic performances. A well-organized PPI and DDI analysis system integrating these data with fair scoring system is necessary.<h4>Method</h4>We integrated three structure-based DDI datasets and twenty computationally predicted DDI datasets and constructed an interaction analysis system, named IDDI, which enables to browse protein and domain interactions with their relationships. To integrate heterogeneous DDI information, a novel scoring scheme is introduced to determine the reliability of DDI by considering the prediction scores of each DDI and the confidence levels of each prediction method in the datasets, and independencies between predicted datasets. In addition, we connected this DDI information to the comprehensive PPI information and developed a unified interface for the interaction analysis exploring interaction networks at both protein and domain level.<h4>Result</h4>IDDI provides 204,705 DDIs among total 7,351 Pfam domains in the current version. The result presents that total number of DDIs is increased eight times more than that of previous studies. Due to the increment of data, 50.4% of PPIs could be correlated with DDIs which is more than twice of previous resources. Newly designed scoring scheme outperformed the previous system in its accuracy too. User interface of IDDI system provides interactive investigation of proteins and domains in interactions with interconnected way.

Clinical interpretation for such patients in isolation is hindered by the rarity and novelty of such disorders. The DECIPHER project (https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk) was established in 2004 as an accessible online repository of genomic and associated phenotypic data with the primary goal of aiding the clinical interpretation of rare copy-number variants (CNVs). DECIPHER integrates information from a variety of bioinformatics resources and uses visualization tools to identify potential disease genes within a CNV. A two-tier access system permits clinicians and clinical scientists to maintain confidential linked anonymous records of phenotypes and CNVs for their patients that, with informed consent, can subsequently be shared with the wider clinical genetics and research communities. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies are making it practical and affordable to sequence the whole exome/genome of patients who display features suggestive of a genetic disorder. This approach enables the identification of smaller intragenic mutations including single-nucleotide variants that are not accessible even with high-resolution genomic array analysis.

One fundamental challenge is the ability to maintain a complete and current catalog of protein diversity. We developed a new approach for the identification of protein families that focuses on the rapid discovery of homologous protein sequences.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented fully automated and high-throughput procedures to de novo cluster proteins into families based upon global alignment similarity. Our approach employs an iterative clustering strategy in which homologs of known families are sifted out of the search for new families. The resulting reduction in computational complexity enables us to rapidly identify novel protein families found in new genomes and to perform efficient, automated updates that keep pace with genome sequencing. We refer to protein families identified through this approach as """"Sifting Families,"""" or SFams.

23095498,"The human """"magnesome"""": detecting magnesium binding sites on human proteins.","<h4>Background</h4>Magnesium research is increasing in molecular medicine due to the relevance of this ion in several important biological processes and associated molecular pathogeneses. It is still difficult to predict from the protein covalent structure whether a human chain is or not involved in magnesium binding. This is mainly due to little information on the structural characteristics of magnesium binding sites in proteins and protein complexes. Magnesium binding features, differently from those of other divalent cations such as calcium and zinc, are elusive. Here we address a question that is relevant in protein annotation: how many human proteins can bind Mg2+? Our analysis is performed taking advantage of the recently implemented Bologna Annotation Resource (BAR-PLUS), a non hierarchical clustering method that relies on the pair wise sequence comparison of about 14 millions proteins from over 300.000 species and their grouping into clusters where annotation can safely be inherited after statistical validation.<h4>Results</h4>After cluster assignment of the latest version of the human proteome, the total number of human proteins for which we can assign putative Mg binding sites is 3,751. Among these proteins, 2,688 inherit annotation directly from human templates and 1,063 inherit annotation from templates of other organisms. Protein structures are highly conserved inside a given cluster. Transfer of structural properties is possible after alignment of a given sequence with the protein structures that characterise a given cluster as obtained with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based procedure. Interestingly a set of 370 human sequences inherit Mg2+ binding sites from templates sharing less than 30% sequence identity with the template.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We describe and deliver the """"human magnesome"""", a set of proteins of the human proteome that inherit putative binding of magnesium ions. With our BAR-hMG, 251 clusters including 1,341 magnesium binding protein structures corresponding to 387 sequences are sufficient to annotate some 13,689 residues in 3,751 human sequences as """"magnesium binding"""". Protein structures act therefore as three dimensional seeds for structural and functional annotation of human sequences.

Aiming to add genetic information potentially useful for novel targets discovery, we performed an extensive genomic characterization by whole-exome sequencing and SNP array profiling of six cutaneous melanoma cell lines derived from metastatic patients. We obtained a total of 3,325 novel coding single nucleotide variants, including 2,172 non-synonymous variants. We catalogued the coding mutations according to Sanger COSMIC database and to a manually curated list including genes involved in melanoma pathways identified by mining recent literature. Besides confirming the presence of known melanoma driver mutations (BRAF(V600E), NRAS(Q61R) ), we identified novel mutated genes involved in signalling pathways crucial for melanoma pathogenesis and already addressed by current targeted therapies (such as MAPK and glutamate pathways). We also identified mutations in four genes (MUC19, PAICS, RBMXL1, KIF23) never reported in melanoma, which might deserve further investigations. All data are available to the entire research community in our Melanoma Exome Database (at https://155.253.6.64/MExDB/). In summary, these cell lines are valuable biological tools to improve the genetic comprehension of this complex cancer disease and to study functional relevance of individual mutational events, and these findings could provide insights potentially useful for identification of novel therapeutic targets for cutaneous malignant melanoma.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
23729657,"The non-obese diabetic mouse sequence, annotation and variation resource: an aid for investigating type 1 diabetes.","Model organisms are becoming increasingly important for the study of complex diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is an experimental model for T1D having been bred to develop the disease spontaneously in a process that is similar to humans. Genetic analysis of the NOD mouse has identified around 50 disease loci, which have the nomenclature Idd for insulin-dependent diabetes, distributed across at least 11 different chromosomes. In total, 21 Idd regions across 6 chromosomes, that are major contributors to T1D susceptibility or resistance, were selected for finished sequencing and annotation at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Here we describe the generation of 40.4 mega base-pairs of finished sequence from 289 bacterial artificial chromosomes for the NOD mouse. Manual annotation has identified 738 genes in the diabetes sensitive NOD mouse and 765 genes in homologous regions of the diabetes resistant C57BL/6J reference mouse across 19 candidate Idd regions. This has allowed us to call variation consequences between homologous exonic sequences for all annotated regions in the two mouse strains. We demonstrate the importance of this resource further by illustrating the technical difficulties that regions of inter-strain structural variation between the NOD mouse and the C57BL/6J reference mouse can cause for current next generation sequencing and assembly techniques. Furthermore, we have established that the variation rate in the Idd regions is 2.3 times higher than the mean found for the whole genome assembly for the NOD/ShiLtJ genome, which we suggest reflects the fact that positive selection for functional variation in immune genes is beneficial in regard to host defence. In summary, we provide an important resource, which aids the analysis of potential causative genes involved in T1D susceptibility.

However, most of the information remains locked up in discrete documents that are not always interconnected or machine-readable. The connectivity tissue provided by RDF technology has not yet been widely used to support the generation of self-describing, machine-readable documents.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we present our approach to the generation of self-describing machine-readable scholarly documents. We understand the scientific document as an entry point and interface to the Web of Data. We have semantically processed the full-text, open-access subset of PubMed Central. Our RDF model and resulting dataset make extensive use of existing ontologies and semantic enrichment services. We expose our model, services, prototype, and datasets at http://biotea.idiginfo.org/<h4>Conclusions</h4>The semantic processing of biomedical literature presented in this paper embeds documents within the Web of Data and facilitates the execution of concept-based queries against the entire digital library. Our approach delivers a flexible and adaptable set of tools for metadata enrichment and semantic processing of biomedical documents. Our model delivers a semantically rich and highly interconnected dataset with self-describing content so that software can make effective use of it.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
23828786,Towards building a disease-phenotype knowledge base: extracting disease-manifestation relationship from literature.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Systems approaches to studying phenotypic relationships among diseases are emerging as an active area of research for both novel disease gene discovery and drug repurposing. Currently, systematic study of disease phenotypic relationships on a phenome-wide scale is limited because large-scale machine-understandable disease-phenotype relationship knowledge bases are often unavailable. Here, we present an automatic approach to extract disease-manifestation (D-M) pairs (one specific type of disease-phenotype relationship) from the wide body of published biomedical literature.<h4>Data and methods</h4>Our method leverages external knowledge and limits the amount of human effort required. For the text corpus, we used 119 085 682 MEDLINE sentences (21 354 075 citations). First, we used D-M pairs from existing biomedical ontologies as prior knowledge to automatically discover D-M-specific syntactic patterns. We then extracted additional pairs from MEDLINE using the learned patterns. Finally, we analysed correlations between disease manifestations and disease-associated genes and drugs to demonstrate the potential of this newly created knowledge base in disease gene discovery and drug repurposing.<h4>Results</h4>In total, we extracted 121 359 unique D-M pairs with a high precision of 0.924. Among the extracted pairs, 120 419 (99.2%) have not been captured in existing structured knowledge sources. We have shown that disease manifestations correlate positively with both disease-associated genes and drug treatments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The main contribution of our study is the creation of a large-scale and accurate D-M phenotype relationship knowledge base. This unique knowledge base, when combined with existing phenotypic, genetic and proteomic datasets, can have profound implications in our deeper understanding of disease etiology and in rapid drug repurposing.<h4>Availability</h4>http://nlp.case.edu/public/data/DMPatternUMLS/","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

The system is built with 82 complete genomes organized into gene families and subfamilies, and their evolutionary relationships are captured in phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments and statistical models (hidden Markov models or HMMs). Genes are classified according to their function in several different ways: families and subfamilies are annotated with ontology terms (Gene Ontology (GO) and PANTHER protein class), and sequences are assigned to PANTHER pathways. The PANTHER website includes a suite of tools that enable users to browse and query gene functions, and to analyze large-scale experimental data with a number of statistical tests. It is widely used by bench scientists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and systems biologists. In the 2013 release of PANTHER (v.8.0), in addition to an update of the data content, we redesigned the website interface to improve both user experience and the system's analytical capability.

The database is an important resource, providing GWAS data that can be used for new exploratory research or cross-study validation by authorized users. However, finding studies relevant to a particular phenotype of interest is challenging, as phenotype information is presented in a non-standardized way. To address this issue, we developed PhenDisco (phenotype discoverer), a new information retrieval system for dbGaP. PhenDisco consists of two main components: (1) text processing tools that standardize phenotype variables and study metadata, and (2) information retrieval tools that support queries from users and return ranked results. In a preliminary comparison involving 18 search scenarios, PhenDisco showed promising performance for both unranked and ranked search comparisons with dbGaP's search engine Entrez.

24060102,Comparative genomics of metabolic capacities of regulons controlled by cis-regulatory RNA motifs in bacteria.,"<h4>Background</h4>In silico comparative genomics approaches have been efficiently used for functional prediction and reconstruction of metabolic and regulatory networks. Riboswitches are metabolite-sensing structures often found in bacterial mRNA leaders controlling gene expression on transcriptional or translational levels.An increasing number of riboswitches and other cis-regulatory RNAs have been recently classified into numerous RNA families in the Rfam database. High conservation of these RNA motifs provides a unique advantage for their genomic identification and comparative analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A comparative genomics approach implemented in the RegPredict tool was used for reconstruction and functional annotation of regulons controlled by RNAs from 43 Rfam families in diverse taxonomic groups of Bacteria. The inferred regulons include ~5200 cis-regulatory RNAs and more than 12000 target genes in 255 microbial genomes. All predicted RNA-regulated genes were classified into specific and overall functional categories. Analysis of taxonomic distribution of these categories allowed us to establish major functional preferences for each analyzed cis-regulatory RNA motif family. Overall, most RNA motif regulons showed predictable functional content in accordance with their experimentally established effector ligands. Our results suggest that some RNA motifs (including thiamin pyrophosphate and cobalamin riboswitches that control the cofactor metabolism) are widespread and likely originated from the last common ancestor of all bacteria. However, many more analyzed RNA motifs are restricted to a narrow taxonomic group of bacteria and likely represent more recent evolutionary innovations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reconstructed regulatory networks for major known RNA motifs substantially expand the existing knowledge of transcriptional regulation in bacteria. The inferred regulons can be used for genetic experiments, functional annotations of genes, metabolic reconstruction and evolutionary analysis. The obtained genome-wide collection of reference RNA motif regulons is available in the RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov/).","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Unfortunately, efficient access, management, and analysis of the data generated by MSI approaches remain major challenges to this rapidly developing field. Despite the availability of numerous dedicated file formats and software packages, it is a widely held viewpoint that the biggest challenge is simply opening, sharing, and analyzing a file without loss of information. Here we present OpenMSI, a software framework and platform that addresses these challenges via an advanced, high-performance, extensible file format and Web API for remote data access (http://openmsi.nersc.gov). The OpenMSI file format supports storage of raw MSI data, metadata, and derived analyses in a single, self-describing format based on HDF5 and is supported by a large range of analysis software (e.g., Matlab and R) and programming languages (e.g., C++, Fortran, and Python). Careful optimization of the storage layout of MSI data sets using chunking, compression, and data replication accelerates common, selective data access operations while minimizing data storage requirements and are critical enablers of rapid data I/O. The OpenMSI file format has shown to provide >2000-fold improvement for image access operations, enabling spectrum and image retrieval in less than 0.3 s across the Internet even for 50 GB MSI data sets. To make remote high-performance compute resources accessible for analysis and to facilitate data sharing and collaboration, we describe an easy-to-use yet powerful Web API, enabling fast and convenient access to MSI data, metadata, and derived analysis results stored remotely to facilitate high-performance data analysis and enable implementation of Web based data sharing, visualization, and analysis.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Since its previous publication in 2012, the number of entries in IDEAL has almost tripled (120 to 340). In addition to the increase in quantity, the quality of IDEAL has been significantly improved. The new IDEAL incorporates the interactions of IDPs and their binding partners more explicitly, and illustrates the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and the structures of protein complexes. Redundant experimental data are arranged based on the clustering of Protein Data Bank entries, and similar sequences with the same binding mode are grouped. As a result, the new IDEAL presents more concise and informative experimental data. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) disorder is annotated in a systematic manner, by identifying the regions with large deviations among the NMR models. The ordered/disordered and new domain predictions by DICHOT are available, as well as the domain assignments by HMMER. Some examples of the PPI networks and the highly deviated regions derived from NMR models will be described, together with other advances.

This represents an increase of 45% in the number of protein sequences since our last publication. Thanks to improvements in the underlying data and pipeline, we see large increases in the domain coverage of sequences. We have expanded this coverage by integrating Pfam and SUPERFAMILY domain annotations, and we now resolve domain overlaps to provide highly comprehensive composite multi-domain architectures. To make these data more accessible for comparative genome analyses, we have developed novel search algorithms for searching genomes to identify related multi-domain architectures. In addition to providing domain family annotations, we have now developed a pipeline for 3D homology modelling of domains in Gene3D. This has been applied to the human genome and will be rolled out to other major organisms over the next year.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Consequently, numerous algorithms have been developed that facilitate structure comparison, including rapid searches against a steadily growing collection of protein structures. To this end, NCBI's Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), which is based on the Protein Data Bank (PDB), maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date archive of protein structure similarities computed with the Vector Alignment Search Tool (VAST). These similarities have been recorded on the level of single proteins and protein domains, comprising in excess of 1.5 billion pairwise alignments. Here we present VAST+, an extension to the existing VAST service, which summarizes and presents structural similarity on the level of biological assemblies or macromolecular complexes. VAST+ simplifies structure neighboring results and shows, for macromolecular complexes tracked in MMDB, lists of similar complexes ranked by the extent of similarity. VAST+ replaces the previous VAST service as the default presentation of structure neighboring data in NCBI's Entrez query and retrieval system.

24372041,miRror2.0: a platform for assessing the joint action of microRNAs in cell regulation.,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate the levels of mRNA post-transcriptionally. Recent experiments revealed thousands of mRNA-miRNA pairs in which multiple miRNAs may bind the same transcript. These results raised the notion of miRNAs teamwork for a wide range of cellular context. miRror2.0 utilizes the miRNA-target predictions from over a dozen programs and resources and unifies them under a common statistical basis. The platform, called miRror2.0, considers the combinatorial regulation by miRNAs in different tissues, cell lines and under a broad range of conditions. A flexible setting permits the selection of the preferred combination of miRNA-target prediction resources as well as the statistical parameters for the analysis. miRror2.0 covers six major model organisms including human and mouse. Importantly, the system is capable of analyzing hundreds of genes that were subjected to miRNAs' regulation. Activating miRror2.0 by introducing thousands of genes from miRNA overexpression experiments successfully identified the objective miRNAs. The output from miRror2.0 is a list of genes that is optimally regulated by a defined set of miRNAs. A symmetric application of miRror2.0 starts with a set of miRNAs, and the system then seeks the preferred set of genes that are regulated by that miRNA composition. The results from miRror2.0 are empowered by an iterative procedure called PSI-miRror. PSI-miRror tests the robustness of miRror2.0 prediction. It allows a refinement of the initial list of genes in view of the miRNAs that optimally regulate this list. We present miRror2.0 as a valuable resource for supporting cellular experimentalists that seek recovery of combinatorial regulation by miRNAs from noisy experimental data. miRror2.0 is available at http://www.mirrorsuite.cs.huji.ac.il .","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,iffy

Pore-lining residues (PLRs) that make direct contacts to the substrates have a crucial impact on the function of the protein and, hence, their identification is a key step in mechanistic studies. Here, we established a nonredundant data set containing the three-dimensional (3D) structures of 90 a-helical transmembrane proteins and annotated the PLRs of these proteins by a pore identification software. A support vector machine was then trained to distinguish PLRs from other residues based on the protein sequence alone. Using sixfold cross-validation, our best performing predictor gave a Matthews's correlation coefficient of 0.41 with an accuracy of 0.86, sensitivity of 0.61, and specificity of 0.89, respectively.

It is expected that curated secondary databases will help organize some of this Big Data thereby allowing users better navigate, search and compute on it.<h4>Results</h4>To address the above challenge, we have implemented a NGS biocuration workflow and are analyzing short read sequences and associated metadata from cancer patients to better understand the human variome. Curation of variation and other related information from control (normal tissue) and case (tumor) samples will provide comprehensive background information that can be used in genomic medicine research and application studies. Our approach includes a CloudBioLinux Virtual Machine which is used upstream of an integrated High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) that encapsulates Curated Short Read archive (CSR) and a proteome-wide variation effect analysis tool (SNVDis). As a proof-of-concept, we have curated and analyzed control and case breast cancer datasets from the NCI cancer genomics program - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our efforts include reviewing and recording in CSR available clinical information on patients, mapping of the reads to the reference followed by identification of non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Variations (nsSNVs) and integrating the data with tools that allow analysis of effect nsSNVs on the human proteome. Furthermore, we have also developed a novel phylogenetic analysis algorithm that uses SNV positions and can be used to classify the patient population. The workflow described here lays the foundation for analysis of short read sequence data to identify rare and novel SNVs that are not present in dbSNP and therefore provides a more comprehensive understanding of the human variome. Variation results for single genes as well as the entire study are available from the CSR website (http://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/dna.cgi?cmd=csr).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Availability of thousands of sequenced samples from patients provides a rich repository of sequence information that can be utilized to identify individual level SNVs and their effect on the human proteome beyond what the dbSNP database provides.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,database but password protected

The rapidly growing size of sequence databases increases the power of such comparative analyses but it makes it more challenging to prepare high quality sequence data sets with control over redundancy, quality, completeness, formatting, and labeling. Software tools for some individual steps in this process exist but manual intervention remains a common and time consuming necessity.<h4>Description</h4>CDSbank is a database that stores both the protein-coding DNA sequence (CDS) and amino acid sequence for each protein annotated in Genbank. CDSbank also stores Genbank feature annotation, a flag to indicate incomplete 5' and 3' ends, full taxonomic data, and a heuristic to rank the scientific interest of each species. This rich information allows fully automated data set preparation with a level of sophistication that aims to meet or exceed manual processing. Defaults ensure ease of use for typical scenarios while allowing great flexibility when needed. Access is via a free web server at http://hazeslab.med.ualberta.ca/CDSbank/.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CDSbank presents a user-friendly web server to download, filter, format, and name large sequence data sets. Common usage scenarios can be accessed via pre-programmed default choices, while optional sections give full control over the processing pipeline. Particular strengths are: extract protein-coding DNA sequences just as easily as amino acid sequences, full access to taxonomy for labeling and filtering, awareness of incomplete sequences, and the ability to take one protein sequence and extract all synonymous CDS or identical protein sequences in other species.

24655548,Analysis of growth factor signaling in genetically diverse breast cancer lines.,"<h4>Background</h4>Soluble growth factors present in the microenvironment play a major role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis, and responsiveness to targeted therapies. While the biochemistry of growth factor-dependent signal transduction has been studied extensively in individual cell types, relatively little systematic data are available across genetically diverse cell lines.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a quantitative and comparative dataset focused on immediate-early signaling that regulates the AKT (AKT1/2/3) and ERK (MAPK1/3) pathways in a canonical panel of well-characterized breast cancer lines. We also provide interactive web-based tools to facilitate follow-on analysis of the data. Our findings show that breast cancers are diverse with respect to ligand sensitivity and signaling biochemistry. Surprisingly, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs; which express low levels of ErbB2, progesterone and estrogen receptors) are the most broadly responsive to growth factors and HER2amp cancers (which overexpress ErbB2) the least. The ratio of ERK to AKT activation varies with ligand and subtype, with a systematic bias in favor of ERK in hormone receptor positive (HR+) cells. The factors that correlate with growth factor responsiveness depend on whether fold-change or absolute activity is considered the key biological variable, and they differ between ERK and AKT pathways.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Responses to growth factors are highly diverse across breast cancer cell lines, even within the same subtype. A simple four-part heuristic suggests that diversity arises from variation in receptor abundance, an ERK/AKT bias that depends on ligand identity, a set of factors common to all receptors that varies in abundance or activity with cell line, and an """"indirect negative regulation"""" by ErbB2. This analysis sets the stage for the development of a mechanistic and predictive model of growth factor signaling in diverse cancer lines.

24678734,Research resource: EPSLiM: ensemble predictor for short linear motifs in nuclear hormone receptors.,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of transcription factors central to regulating many biological processes, including cell growth, death, metabolism, and immune responses. NR-mediated gene expression can be modulated by coactivators and corepressors through direct physical interaction or protein complexes with functional domains in NRs. One class of these domains includes short linear motifs (SLiMs), which facilitate protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and ligand binding primarily in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins. Across all proteins, the number of known SLiMs is limited due to the difficulty in studying IDRs experimentally. Computational tools provide a systematic and data-driven approach for predicting functional motifs that can be used to prioritize experimental efforts. Accordingly, several tools have been developed based on sequence conservation or biophysical features; however, discrepancies in predictions make it difficult to determine the true candidate SLiMs. In this work, we present the ensemble predictor for short linear motifs (EPSLiM), a novel strategy to prioritize the residues that are most likely to be SLiMs in IDRs. EPSLiM applies a generalized linear model to integrate predictions from individual methodologies. We show that EPSLiM outperforms individual predictors, and we apply our method to NRs. The androgen receptor is an example with an N-terminal domain of 559 disordered amino acids that contains several validated SLiMs important for transcriptional activation. We use the androgen receptor to illustrate the predictive performance of EPSLiM and make the results of all human and mouse NRs publically available through the web service http://epslim.bwh.harvard.edu.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,resulting data is what's available
24727366,"'In silico expression analysis', a novel PathoPlant web tool to identify abiotic and biotic stress conditions associated with specific cis-regulatory sequences.","Using bioinformatics, putative cis-regulatory sequences can be easily identified using pattern recognition programs on promoters of specific gene sets. The abundance of predicted cis-sequences is a major challenge to associate these sequences with a possible function in gene expression regulation. To identify a possible function of the predicted cis-sequences, a novel web tool designated 'in silico expression analysis' was developed that correlates submitted cis-sequences with gene expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana. The web tool identifies the A. thaliana genes harbouring the sequence in a defined promoter region and compares the expression of these genes with microarray data. The result is a hierarchy of abiotic and biotic stress conditions to which these genes are most likely responsive. When testing the performance of the web tool, known cis-regulatory sequences were submitted to the 'in silico expression analysis' resulting in the correct identification of the associated stress conditions. When using a recently identified novel elicitor-responsive sequence, a WT-box (CGACTTTT), the 'in silico expression analysis' predicts that genes harbouring this sequence in their promoter are most likely Botrytis cinerea induced. Consistent with this prediction, the strongest induction of a reporter gene harbouring this sequence in the promoter is observed with B. cinerea in transgenic A. thaliana.

24885229,A comprehensive assessment of the transcriptome of cork oak (Quercus suber) through EST sequencing.,"<h4>Background</h4>Cork oak (Quercus suber) is one of the rare trees with the ability to produce cork, a material widely used to make wine bottle stoppers, flooring and insulation materials, among many other uses. The molecular mechanisms of cork formation are still poorly understood, in great part due to the difficulty in studying a species with a long life-cycle and for which there is scarce molecular/genomic information. Cork oak forests are of great ecological importance and represent a major economic and social resource in Southern Europe and Northern Africa. However, global warming is threatening the cork oak forests by imposing thermal, hydric and many types of novel biotic stresses. Despite the economic and social value of the Q. suber species, few genomic resources have been developed, useful for biotechnological applications and improved forest management.<h4>Results</h4>We generated in excess of 7 million sequence reads, by pyrosequencing 21 normalized cDNA libraries derived from multiple Q. suber tissues and organs, developmental stages and physiological conditions. We deployed a stringent sequence processing and assembly pipeline that resulted in the identification of ~159,000 unigenes. These were annotated according to their similarity to known plant genes, to known Interpro domains, GO classes and E.C. numbers. The phylogenetic extent of this ESTs set was investigated, and we found that cork oak revealed a significant new gene space that is not covered by other model species or EST sequencing projects. The raw data, as well as the full annotated assembly, are now available to the community in a dedicated web portal at http://www.corkoakdb.org.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This genomic resource represents the first trancriptome study in a cork producing species. It can be explored to develop new tools and approaches to understand stress responses and developmental processes in forest trees, as well as the molecular cascades underlying cork differentiation and disease response.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
25119676,Improvements to pairwise sequence comparison (PASC): a genome-based web tool for virus classification.,"The number of viral genome sequences in the public databases is increasing dramatically, and these sequences are playing an important role in virus classification. Pairwise sequence comparison is a sequence-based virus classification method. A program using this method calculates the pairwise identities of virus sequences within a virus family and displays their distribution, and visual analysis helps to determine demarcations at different taxonomic levels such as strain, species, genus and subfamily. Subsequent comparison of new sequences against existing ones allows viruses from which the new sequences were derived to be classified. Although this method cannot be used as the only criterion for virus classification in some cases, it is a quantitative method and has many advantages over conventional virus classification methods. It has been applied to several virus families, and there is an increasing interest in using this method for other virus families/groups. The Pairwise Sequence Comparison (PASC) classification tool was created at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The tool's database stores pairwise identities for complete genomes/segments of 56 virus families/groups. Data in the system are updated every day to reflect changes in virus taxonomy and additions of new virus sequences to the public database. The web interface of the tool ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/pasc/ ) makes it easy to navigate and perform analyses. Multiple new viral genome sequences can be tested simultaneously with this system to suggest the taxonomic position of virus isolates in a specific family. PASC eliminates potential discrepancies in the results caused by different algorithms and/or different data used by researchers.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
25179504,Differential motif enrichment analysis of paired ChIP-seq experiments.,"<h4>Background</h4>Motif enrichment analysis of transcription factor ChIP-seq data can help identify transcription factors that cooperate or compete. Previously, little attention has been given to comparative motif enrichment analysis of pairs of ChIP-seq experiments, where the binding of the same transcription factor is assayed under different conditions. Such comparative analysis could potentially identify the distinct regulatory partners/competitors of the assayed transcription factor under different conditions or at different stages of development.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a new methodology for identifying sequence motifs that are differentially enriched in one set of DNA or RNA sequences relative to another set, and apply it to paired ChIP-seq experiments. We show that, using paired ChIP-seq data for a single transcription factor, differential motif enrichment analysis identifies all the known key transcription factors involved in the transformation of non-cancerous immortalized breast cells (MCF10A-ER-Src cells) into cancer stem cells whereas non-differential motif enrichment analysis does not. We also show that differential motif enrichment analysis identifies regulatory motifs that are significantly enriched at constrained locations within the bound promoters, and that these motifs are not identified by non-differential motif enrichment analysis. Our methodology differs from other approaches in that it leverages both comparative enrichment and positional enrichment of motifs in ChIP-seq peak regions or in the promoters of genes bound by the transcription factor.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We show that differential motif enrichment analysis of paired ChIP-seq experiments offers biological insights not available from non-differential analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, our method detects motifs that are enriched in a constrained region in one set of sequences, but not enriched in the same region in the comparative set. We have enhanced the web-based CentriMo algorithm to allow it to perform the constrained differential motif enrichment analysis described in this paper, and CentriMo's on-line interface (http://meme.ebi.edu.au) provides dozens of databases of DNA- and RNA-binding motifs from a full range of organisms.

25540186,Knowledge-based modeling of peptides at protein interfaces: PiPreD.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underpin virtually all cellular processes both in health and disease. Modulating the interaction between proteins by means of small (chemical) agents is therefore a promising route for future novel therapeutic interventions. In this context, peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of PPIs.<h4>Results</h4>We reported a novel computational, structure and knowledge-based approach to model orthosteric peptides to target PPIs: PiPreD. PiPreD relies on a precompiled and bespoken library of structural motifs, iMotifs, extracted from protein complexes and a fast structural modeling algorithm driven by the location of native chemical groups on the interface of the protein target named anchor residues. PiPreD comprehensive and systematically samples the entire interface deriving peptide conformations best suited for the given region on the protein interface.

25629077,Genetic variability of microRNA regulome in human.,"MicroRNAs are currently being extensively studied due to their important role as post-transcriptional regulators. During miRNA biogenesis, precursors undergo two cleavage steps performed by Drosha-DGCR8 (Microprocessor) cleaving of pri-miRNA to produce pre-miRNA and Dicer-mediated cleaving to create mature miRNA. Genetic variants within human miRNA regulome have been shown to influence miRNA expression, target interaction and to affect the phenotype. In this study, we reviewed the literature, existing bioinformatics tools and catalogs associated with polymorphic miRNA regulome, and organized them into four categories: (1) polymorphisms located within miRNA genes (miR-SNPs), (2) transcription factor-binding sites/miRNA regulatory regions (miR-rSNPs), (3) miRNA target sites (miR-TS-SNPs), and 4. miRNA silencing machinery (miR-SM-SNPs). Since the miR-SM-SNPs have not been systematically studied yet, we have collected polymorphisms associated with miRNA silencing machinery. We have developed two catalogs containing genetic variability within: (1) genes encoding three main catalytic components of the silencing machinery, DROSHA, DGCR8, and DICER1; (2) miRNA genes itself, overlapping Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites. The developed resource of polymorphisms is available online (http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-regulome) and will be useful for further functional studies and development of biomarkers associated with diseases and phenotypic traits.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

In this study, we surveyed all the available literature describing PARK2 gene/Parkin protein mutations found in Parkinson disease patients. Only carefully evaluated data were deposited in the graphical database MutationView (http://mutview.dmb.med.keio.ac.jp) to construct KM-parkin-DB, an independent sub-set database. Forty-four articles were selected for data curation regarding clinical information such as ethnic origins, manifested symptoms, onset age, and hereditary patterns as well as mutation details including base changes and zygosity. A total of 366 cases were collected from 39 ethnic origins and 96 pathogenic mutations were found. PARK2 gene mutations were found also in some general Parkinson disease patients. The majority (63%) of mutations in PARK2 were restricted to two particular domains (UBL and RING1) of the Parkin protein.

26043787,Detection and analysis of disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphism influencing post-translational modification.,"Post-translational modification (PTM) plays a crucial role in biological functions and corresponding disease developments. Discovering disease-associated non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) altering PTM sites can help to estimate the various PTM candidates involved in diseases, therefore, an integrated analysis between SNPs, PTMs and diseases is necessary. However, only a few types of PTMs affected by nsSNPs have been studied without considering disease-association until now. In this study, we developed a new database called PTM-SNP which contains a comprehensive collection of human nsSNPs that affect PTM sites, together with disease information. Total 179,325 PTM-SNPs were collected by aligning missense SNPs and stop-gain SNPs on PTM sites (position 0) or their flanking region (position -7 to 7). Disease-associated SNPs from GWAS catalogs were also matched with detected PTM-SNP to find disease associated PTM-SNPs. Our result shows PTM-SNPs are highly associated with diseases, compared with other nsSNP sites and functional classes including near gene, intron and so on. PTM-SNP can provide an insight about discovering important PTMs involved in the diseases easily through the web site.

26109357,Gene Model Annotations for Drosophila melanogaster: Impact of High-Throughput Data.,"We report the current status of the FlyBase annotated gene set for Drosophila melanogaster and highlight improvements based on high-throughput data. The FlyBase annotated gene set consists entirely of manually annotated gene models, with the exception of some classes of small non-coding RNAs. All gene models have been reviewed using evidence from high-throughput datasets, primarily from the modENCODE project. These datasets include RNA-Seq coverage data, RNA-Seq junction data, transcription start site profiles, and translation stop-codon read-through predictions. New annotation guidelines were developed to take into account the use of the high-throughput data. We describe how this flood of new data was incorporated into thousands of new and revised annotations. FlyBase has adopted a philosophy of excluding low-confidence and low-frequency data from gene model annotations; we also do not attempt to represent all possible permutations for complex and modularly organized genes. This has allowed us to produce a high-confidence, manageable gene annotation dataset that is available at FlyBase (http://flybase.org). Interesting aspects of new annotations include new genes (coding, non-coding, and antisense), many genes with alternative transcripts with very long 3' UTRs (up to 15-18 kb), and a stunning mismatch in the number of male-specific genes (approximately 13% of all annotated gene models) vs. female-specific genes (less than 1%). The number of identified pseudogenes and mutations in the sequenced strain also increased significantly. We discuss remaining challenges, for instance, identification of functional small polypeptides and detection of alternative translation starts.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
26148193,Basic Emotions in the Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL BE): New Method of Classifying Emotional Stimuli.,"The Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL) has recently been introduced as a standardized database of Polish words suitable for studying various aspects of language and emotions. Though the NAWL was originally based on the most commonly used dimensional approach, it is not the only way of studying emotions. Another framework is based on discrete emotional categories. Since the two perspectives are recognized as complementary, the aim of the present study was to supplement the NAWL database by the addition of categories corresponding to basic emotions. Thus, 2902 Polish words from the NAWL were presented to 265 subjects, who were instructed to rate them according to the intensity of each of the five basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear and disgust. The general characteristics of the present word database, as well as the relationships between the studied variables are shown to be consistent with typical patterns found in previous studies using similar databases for different languages. Here we present the Basic Emotions in the Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL BE) as a database of verbal material suitable for highly controlled experimental research. To make the NAWL more convenient to use, we introduce a comprehensive method of classifying stimuli to basic emotion categories. We discuss the advantages of our method in comparison to other methods of classification. Additionally, we provide an interactive online tool (http://exp.lobi.nencki.gov.pl/nawl-analysis) to help researchers browse and interactively generate classes of stimuli to meet their specific requirements.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Many protein functions are based on interaction with other proteins. The structural information is important for adequate description of these interactions. Sets of protein structures determined in both bound and unbound states are essential for benchmarking of the docking procedures. However, the number of such proteins in PDB is relatively small. A radical expansion of such sets is possible if the unbound structures are computationally simulated.<h4>Results</h4>The DOCKGROUND public resource provides data to improve our understanding of protein-protein interactions and to assist in the development of better tools for structural modeling of protein complexes, such as docking algorithms and scoring functions. A large set of simulated unbound protein structures was generated from the bound structures. The modeling protocol was based on 1 ns Langevin dynamics simulation. The simulated structures were validated on the ensemble of experimentally determined unbound and bound structures. The set is intended for large scale benchmarking of docking algorithms and scoring functions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A radical expansion of the unbound protein docking benchmark set was achieved by simulating the unbound structures. The simulated unbound structures were selected according to criteria from systematic comparison of experimentally determined bound and unbound structures.

Computational predictions are often used in the development of devices and reliable in vitro data is needed to validate computational results, particularly estimations of the Reynolds stresses that could play a role in damaging blood elements. The high spatial resolution of laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) is used to collect two component velocity data within the FDA benchmark nozzle model. Two flow conditions are used to produce flow encompassing laminar, transitional, and turbulent regimes, and viscous stresses, principal Reynolds stresses, and turbulence intensities are calculated from the measured LDV velocities. Axial velocities and viscous stresses are compared to data from a prior inter-laboratory study conducted with particle image velocimetry. Large velocity gradients are observed near the wall in the nozzle throat and in the jet shear layer located in the expansion downstream of the throat, with axial velocity changing as much as 4.5m/s over 200m. Additionally, maximum Reynolds shear stresses of 1000-2000Pa are calculated in the high shear regions, which are an order of magnitude higher than the peak viscous shear stresses (<100Pa). It is important to consider the effects of both viscous and turbulent stresses when simulating flow through medical devices. Reynolds stresses above commonly accepted hemolysis thresholds are measured in the nozzle model, indicating that hemolysis may occur under certain flow conditions. As such, the presented turbulence quantities from LDV, which are also available for download at https://fdacfd.nci.nih.gov/ , provide an ideal validation test for computational simulations that seek to characterize the flow field and to predict hemolysis within the FDA nozzle geometry.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,iffy

Here, we describe the new corpora in the systems biology modeling language BEL for training and testing biological relationship extraction systems that we prepared for the BioCreative V BEL track. BEL was designed to capture relationships not only between proteins or chemicals, but also complex events such as biological processes or disease states. A BEL nanopub is the smallest unit of information and represents a biological relationship with its provenance. In BEL relationships (called BEL statements), the entities are normalized to defined namespaces mainly derived from public repositories, such as sequence databases, MeSH or publicly available ontologies. In the BEL nanopubs, the BEL statements are associated with citation information and supportive evidence such as a text excerpt. To enable the training of extraction tools, we prepared BEL resources and made them available to the community. We selected a subset of these resources focusing on a reduced set of namespaces, namely, human and mouse genes, ChEBI chemicals, MeSH diseases and GO biological processes, as well as relationship types 'increases' and 'decreases'. The published training corpus contains 11 000 BEL statements from over 6000 supportive text excerpts. For method evaluation, we selected and re-annotated two smaller subcorpora containing 100 text excerpts. For this re-annotation, the inter-annotator agreement was measured by the BEL track evaluation environment and resulted in a maximal F-score of 91.18% for full statement agreement.

Moreover, POSTAR provides a friendly, multi-mode, integrated search interface, which helps users to connect multiple RBP binding sites with post-transcriptional regulatory events, phenotypes, and diseases. Based on our platform, we were able to obtain novel insights into post-transcriptional regulation, such as the putative association between CPSF6 binding, RNA structural domains, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome SNPs.

Consistent with previous reports using smaller datasets, we found that Tyr, Trp, Ser, Asn, Asp, Thr, Arg, Gly, His contribute substantially to the interactions between antibody and antigen. Furthermore, antibody-antigen interactions can be mediated by interfacial waters. However, there is no reported comprehensive analysis for a large number of structured waters that engage in higher ordered structures at the antibody-antigen interface. From our dataset, we have found the presence of interfacial waters in 242 complexes. We present evidence that suggests a compelling role of these interfacial waters in interactions of antibodies with a range of antigens differing in shape complementarity. Finally, we carry out 296 835 pairwise 3D structure comparisons of 771 structures of contact residues of antibodies with their interfacial water molecules from our dataset using CLICK method. A heuristic clustering algorithm is used to obtain unique structural similarities, and found to separate into 368 different clusters. These clusters are used to identify structural motifs of contact residues of antibodies for epitope binding.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>This clustering database of contact residues is freely accessible at http://mspc.bii.a-star.edu.sg/minhn/pclick.html.<h4>Contact</h4>minhn@bii.a-star.edu.sg, chandra@bii.a-star.edu.sg or zhong_pingyu@immunol.a-star.edu.sg.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
28827280,Systematic and Quantitative Assessment of Hydrogen Peroxide Reactivity With Cysteines Across Human Proteomes.,"Protein cysteinyl residues are the mediators of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-dependent redox signaling. However, site-specific mapping of the selectivity and dynamics of these redox reactions in cells poses a major analytical challenge. Here we describe a chemoproteomic platform to systematically and quantitatively analyze the reactivity of thousands of cysteines toward H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in human cells. We identified >900 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive cysteines, which are defined as the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent redoxome. Although redox sites associated with antioxidative and metabolic functions are consistent, most of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent redoxome varies dramatically between different cells. Structural analyses reveal that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive cysteines are less conserved than their redox-insensitive counterparts and display distinct sequence motifs, structural features, and potential for crosstalk with lysine modifications. Notably, our chemoproteomic platform also provides an opportunity to predict oxidation-triggered protein conformational changes. The data are freely accessible as a resource at http://redox.ncpsb.org/OXID/.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
28968848,A comprehensive assessment of long intrinsic protein disorder from the DisProt database.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Intrinsic disorder (ID), i.e. the lack of a unique folded conformation at physiological conditions, is a common feature for many proteins, which requires specialized biochemical experiments that are not high-throughput. Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been used for training ID predictors.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is different than for PDB data. In particular, many predictors appear to confound ID and regions outside X-ray structures. This suggests that the ID prediction methods capture different flavors of disorder and can benefit from highly accurate curated examples.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The raw data used for the evaluation are available from URL: http://www.disprot.org/assessment/.<h4>Contact</h4>silvio.tosatto@unipd.it.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Several resources for information regarding Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) are available on the Web. In this chapter, we focus on recently published resources for Brachypodium research. The Brachypodium.org website ( http://www.brachypodium.org /) is an information portal that provides links to various genomic resources regarding Brachypodium, including genome annotation and re-sequencing datasets of accessions. RIKEN Full-length cDNA Database (RBFLDB, http://brachy.bmep.riken.jp/ver.1/index.pl ) is a web-accessible database that provides information of Brachypodium full-length cDNAs (FLcDNAs) collected in RIKEN and updated gene structures of Brachypodium based on the FLcDNA sequences as well as results of comparative analyses with available sequence resources for Triticeae crops, wheat, and barley.

29155427,PDB-wide identification of biological assemblies from conserved quaternary structure geometry.,"Protein structures are key to understanding biomolecular mechanisms and diseases, yet their interpretation is hampered by limited knowledge of their biologically relevant quaternary structure (QS). A critical challenge in inferring QS information from crystallographic data is distinguishing biological interfaces from fortuitous crystal-packing contacts. Here, we tackled this problem by developing strategies for aligning and comparing QS states across both homologs and data repositories. QS conservation across homologs proved remarkably strong at predicting biological relevance and is implemented in two methods, QSalign and anti-QSalign, for annotating homo-oligomers and monomers, respectively. QS conservation across repositories is implemented in QSbio (http://www.QSbio.org), which approaches the accuracy of manual curation and allowed us to predict >100,000 QS states across the Protein Data Bank. Based on this high-quality data set, we analyzed pairs of structurally conserved interfaces, and this analysis revealed a striking plasticity whereby evolutionary distant interfaces maintain similar interaction geometries through widely divergent chemical properties.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,iffy
29161266,Knowledge-based prediction of protein backbone conformation using a structural alphabet.,"Libraries of structural prototypes that abstract protein local structures are known as structural alphabets and have proven to be very useful in various aspects of protein structure analyses and predictions. One such library, Protein Blocks, is composed of 16 standard 5-residues long structural prototypes. This form of analyzing proteins involves drafting its structure as a string of Protein Blocks. Predicting the local structure of a protein in terms of protein blocks is the general objective of this work. A new approach, PB-kPRED is proposed towards this aim. It involves (i) organizing the structural knowledge in the form of a database of pentapeptide fragments extracted from all protein structures in the PDB and (ii) applying a knowledge-based algorithm that does not rely on any secondary structure predictions and/or sequence alignment profiles, to scan this database and predict most probable backbone conformations for the protein local structures. Though PB-kPRED uses the structural information from homologues in preference, if available. The predictions were evaluated rigorously on 15,544 query proteins representing a non-redundant subset of the PDB filtered at 30% sequence identity cut-off. We have shown that the kPRED method was able to achieve mean accuracies ranging from 40.8% to 66.3% depending on the availability of homologues. The impact of the different strategies for scanning the database on the prediction was evaluated and is discussed. Our results highlight the usefulness of the method in the context of proteins without any known structural homologues. A scoring function that gives a good estimate of the accuracy of prediction was further developed. This score estimates very well the accuracy of the algorithm (R2 of 0.82).

In 2014, the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded an Administrative Supplement to the PhenX Toolkit (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures; https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/) to identify common measures to promote data comparability across SCD research. An 11-member Sickle Cell Disease Research and Scientific Panel provided guidance to the project, establishing a core collection of SCD-related measures and defining the scope of 2 specialty collections: (1) cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal complications, and (2) neurology, quality-of-life, and health services. For each specialty collection, a working group of SCD experts selected high-priority measures using a consensus process that included scientific community input. The SCD measures were released into the Toolkit in August 2015. The 25 measures included in the core collection are recommended for use by all NHLBI-funded investigators performing human-subject SCD research. The 10 neurology, quality-of-life, and health services measures and 14 cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal measures are recommended for use within these specialized research areas. For SCD and other researchers, PhenX measures will promote collaborations with clinicians and patients, facilitate cross-study analysis, accelerate translational research, and lead to greater understanding of SCD phenotypes and epigenetics. For clinicians, using PhenX measures will help elucidate the etiology, progression, and treatment of SCD, leading to improved patient care and quality of life.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Four core content areas are independently curated: chemical-gene interactions, chemical-disease and gene-disease associations, chemical-phenotype interactions, and environmental exposure data (e.g., effects of chemical stressors on humans). Since releasing exposure data in 2015, we have vastly increased our coverage of chemicals and disease/phenotype outcomes; greatly expanded access to exposure content; added search capability by stressors, cohorts, population demographics, and measured outcomes; and created user-specified displays of content. These enhancements aim to facilitate human studies by allowing comparisons among experimental parameters and across studies involving specified chemicals, populations, or outcomes. Integration of data among CTD's four content areas and external data sets, such as Gene Ontology annotations and pathway information, links exposure data with over 1.8 million chemical-gene, chemical-disease and gene-disease interactions. Our analysis tools reveal direct and inferred relationships among the data and provide opportunities to generate predictive connections between environmental exposures and population-level health outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2873.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Based on a contemporary printed corpus of over 227 million words, P-PAL provides a broad range of word attributes and statistics, including several measures of word frequency (e.g., raw counts, per-million word frequency, logarithmic Zipf scale), morpho-syntactic information (e.g., parts of speech [PoSs], grammatical gender and number, dominant PoS, and frequency and relative frequency of the dominant PoS), as well as several lexical and sublexical orthographic (e.g., number of letters; consonant-vowel orthographic structure; density and frequency of orthographic neighbors; orthographic Levenshtein distance; orthographic uniqueness point; orthographic syllabification; and trigram, bigram, and letter type and token frequencies), and phonological measures (e.g., pronunciation, number of phonemes, stress, density and frequency of phonological neighbors, transposed and phonographic neighbors, syllabification, and biphone and phone type and token frequencies) for ~53,000 lemmatized and ~208,000 nonlemmatized EP word forms. To obtain these metrics, researchers can choose between two word queries in the application: (i) analyze words previously selected for specific attributes and/or lexical and sublexical characteristics, or (ii) generate word lists that meet word requirements defined by the user in the menu of analyses. For the measures it provides and the flexibility it allows, P-PAL will be a key resource to support research in all cognitive areas that use EP verbal stimuli.

29990104,A Robust 3D-2D Interactive Tool for Scene Segmentation and Annotation.,"Recent advances of 3D acquisition devices have enabled large-scale acquisition of 3D scene data. Such data, if completely and well annotated, can serve as useful ingredients for a wide spectrum of computer vision and graphics works such as data-driven modeling and scene understanding, object detection and recognition. However, annotating a vast amount of 3D scene data remains challenging due to the lack of an effective tool and/or the complexity of 3D scenes (e.g. clutter, varying illumination conditions). This paper aims to build a robust annotation tool that effectively and conveniently enables the segmentation and annotation of massive 3D data. Our tool works by coupling 2D and 3D information via an interactive framework, through which users can provide high-level semantic annotation for objects. We have experimented our tool and found that a typical indoor scene could be well segmented and annotated in less than 30 minutes by using the tool, as opposed to a few hours if done manually. Along with the tool, we created a dataset of over a hundred 3D scenes associated with complete annotations using our tool.

29990255,Meta-Path Methods for Prioritizing Candidate Disease miRNAs.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional levels. Numerous experimental studies indicate that alterations and dysregulations in miRNAs are associated with important complex diseases, especially cancers. Predicting potential miRNA-disease association is beneficial not only to explore the pathogenesis of diseases, but also to understand biological processes. In this work, we propose two methods that can effectively predict potential miRNA-disease associations using our reconstructed miRNA and disease similarity networks, which are based on the latest experimental data. We reconstruct a miRNA functional similarity network using the following biological information: the miRNA family information, miRNA cluster information, experimentally valid miRNA-target association and disease-miRNA information. We also reconstruct a disease similarity network using disease functional information and disease semantic information. We present Katz with specific weights and Katz with machine learning, on the comprehensive heterogeneous network. These methods, which achieve corresponding AUC values of 0.897 and 0.919, exhibit performance superior to the existing methods. Comprehensive data networks and reasonable considerations guarantee the high performance of our methods. Contrary to several methods, which cannot work in such situations, the proposed methods also predict associations for diseases without any known related miRNAs.

In this study, we present the first functional clustering and evolutionary analysis of the RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) based on similarities between active-site structures. All of the ligand-bound proteins within the RCSB PDB were scored using our Comparison of Protein Active-site Structures (CPASS) software and database (http://cpass.unl.edu/). Principal component analysis was then used to identify 4431 representative structures to construct a phylogenetic tree based on the CPASS comparative scores (http://itol.embl.de/shared/jcatazaro).

On a genome-wide scale, we implemented multiple databases and algorithms to predict and prioritize the human aging genes (PPHAGE). RESULTS:We fused data from 11 databases, and used Nave Bayes classifier and positive unlabeled learning (PUL) methods, NB, Spy, and Rocchio-SVM, to rank human genes in respect with their implication in aging. The PUL methods enabled us to identify a list of negative (non-aging) genes to use alongside the seed (known age-related) genes in the ranking process. Comparison of the PUL algorithms revealed that none of the methods for identifying a negative sample were advantageous over other methods, and their simultaneous use in a form of fusion was critical for obtaining optimal results (PPHAGE is publicly available at https://cbb.ut.ac.ir/pphage). CONCLUSION:We predict and prioritize over 3,000 candidate age-related genes in human, based on significant ranking scores. The identified candidate genes are associated with pathways, ontologies, and diseases that are linked to aging, such as cancer and diabetes. Our data offer a platform for future experimental research on the genetic and biological aspects of aging. Additionally, we demonstrate that fusion of PUL methods and data sources can be successfully used for aging and disease candidate gene prioritization.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,

Hence, information regarding the cell-type-specific expression patterns is needed to prioritise potential pathogenic variants that contribute to the pathogenesis of azoospermia. Thanks to technological advances within next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to obtain detailed cell-type-specific expression patterns in the testis by single-cell RNA sequencing. However, to interpret single-cell RNA sequencing data properly, substantial knowledge of the highly sophisticated data processing and visualisation methods is needed. Here we review the complex cellular structure of the human testis in different types of azoospermia and outline how known genetic alterations affect the pathology of the testis. We combined the currently available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets originating from the human testis into one dataset covering 62,751 testicular cells, each with a median of 2637 transcripts quantified. We show what effects the most common data-processing steps have, and how different visualisation methods can be used. Furthermore, we calculated expression patterns in pseudotime, and show how splicing rates can be used to determine the velocity of differentiation during spermatogenesis. With the combined dataset we show expression patterns and network analysis of genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis of azoospermia.

However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand the spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
32392296,CoCoCoNet: conserved and comparative co-expression across a diverse set of species.,"Co-expression analysis has provided insight into gene function in organisms from Arabidopsis to zebrafish. Comparison across species has the potential to enrich these results, for example by prioritizing among candidate human disease genes based on their network properties or by finding alternative model systems where their co-expression is conserved. Here, we present CoCoCoNet as a tool for identifying conserved gene modules and comparing co-expression networks. CoCoCoNet is a resource for both data and methods, providing gold standard networks and sophisticated tools for on-the-fly comparative analyses across 14 species. We show how CoCoCoNet can be used in two use cases. In the first, we demonstrate deep conservation of a nucleolus gene module across very divergent organisms, and in the second, we show how the heterogeneity of autism mechanisms in humans can be broken down by functional groups and translated to model organisms. CoCoCoNet is free to use and available to all at https://milton.cshl.edu/CoCoCoNet, with data and R scripts available at ftp://milton.cshl.edu/data.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
32449511,A strategy for large-scale comparison of evolutionary- and reaction-based classifications of enzyme function.,"Determining the molecular function of enzymes discovered by genome sequencing represents a primary foundation for understanding many aspects of biology. Historically, classification of enzyme reactions has used the enzyme nomenclature system developed to describe the overall reactions performed by biochemically characterized enzymes, irrespective of their associated sequences. In contrast, functional classification and assignment for the millions of protein sequences of unknown function now available is largely done in two computational steps, first by similarity-based assignment of newly obtained sequences to homologous groups, followed by transferring to them the known functions of similar biochemically characterized homologs. Due to the fundamental differences in their etiologies and practice, `how' these chemistry- and evolution-centric functional classification systems relate to each other has been difficult to explore on a large scale. To investigate this issue in a new way, we integrated two published ontologies that had previously described each of these classification systems independently. The resulting infrastructure was then used to compare the functional assignments obtained from each classification system for the well-studied and functionally diverse enolase superfamily. Mapping these function assignments to protein structure and reaction similarity networks shows a profound and complex disconnect between the homology- and chemistry-based classification systems. This conclusion mirrors previous observations suggesting that except for closely related sequences, facile annotation transfer from small numbers of characterized enzymes to the huge number uncharacterized homologs to which they are related is problematic. Our extension of these comparisons to large enzyme superfamilies in a computationally intelligent manner provides a foundation for new directions in protein function prediction for the huge proportion of sequences of unknown function represented in major databases. Interactive sequence, reaction, substrate and product similarity networks computed for this work for the enolase and two other superfamilies are freely available for download from the Structure Function Linkage Database Archive (http://sfld.rbvi.ucsf.edu).","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
32614398,Using AnABlast for intergenic sORF prediction in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Short bioactive peptides encoded by small open reading frames (sORFs) play important roles in eukaryotes. Bioinformatics prediction of ORFs is an early step in a genome sequence analysis, but sORFs encoding short peptides, often using non-AUG initiation codons, are not easily discriminated from false ORFs occurring by chance.<h4>Results</h4>AnABlast is a computational tool designed to highlight putative protein-coding regions in genomic DNA sequences. This protein-coding finder is independent of ORF length and reading frame shifts, thus making of AnABlast a potentially useful tool to predict sORFs. Using this algorithm, here, we report the identification of 82 putative new intergenic sORFs in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome. Sequence similarity, motif presence, expression data and RNA interference experiments support that the underlined sORFs likely encode functional peptides, encouraging the use of AnABlast as a new approach for the accurate prediction of intergenic sORFs in annotated eukaryotic genomes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>AnABlast is freely available at http://www.bioinfocabd.upo.es/ab/.

32765587,ABC-GWAS: Functional Annotation of Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Genetic Variants.,"Over the past decade, hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated genetic variants in various diseases, including cancer. However, only a few of these variants have been functionally characterized to date, mainly because the majority of the variants reside in non-coding regions of the human genome with unknown function. A comprehensive functional annotation of the candidate variants is thus necessary to fill the gap between the correlative findings of GWAS and the development of therapeutic strategies. By integrating large-scale multi-omics datasets such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), we performed multivariate linear regression analysis of expression quantitative trait loci, sequence permutation test of transcription factor binding perturbation, and modeling of three-dimensional chromatin interactions to analyze the potential molecular functions of 2,813 single nucleotide variants in 93 genomic loci associated with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. To facilitate rapid progress in functional genomics of breast cancer, we have created """"Analysis of Breast Cancer GWAS"""" (ABC-GWAS), an interactive database of functional annotation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer GWAS variants. Our resource includes expression quantitative trait loci, long-range chromatin interaction predictions, and transcription factor binding motif analyses to prioritize putative target genes, causal variants, and transcription factors. An embedded genome browser also facilitates convenient visualization of the GWAS loci in genomic and epigenomic context. ABC-GWAS provides an interactive visual summary of comprehensive functional characterization of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer variants. The web resource will be useful to both computational and experimental biologists who wish to generate and test their hypotheses regarding the genetic susceptibility, etiology, and carcinogenesis of breast cancer.

They have been created by a set of transforms based on an adaptation and extension of the CHMTRN/PATRAN programming languages describing chemical synthesis expert knowledge, which originally stem from the LHASA project. The chemoinformatics toolkit CACTVS was used to apply a total of 53 transforms to about 150,000 readily available building blocks (enamine.net). Only single-step, two-reactant syntheses were calculated for this database even though the technology can execute multi-step reactions. The possibility to incorporate scoring systems in CHMTRN allowed us to subdivide the database of 1.75 billion compounds in sets according to their predicted synthesizability, with the most-synthesizable class comprising 1.09 billion synthetic products.

However, it is significantly limited by the absence of a universal database of reference mass spectra. This problem can be solved by creating an Internet platform for open databases of protein spectra of microorganisms. Choosing the optimal mathematical apparatus is the pivotal issue for this task. In our previous study we proposed the geometric approach for processing mass spectrometry data, which represented a mass spectrum as a vector in a multidimensional Euclidean space. This algorithm was implemented in a Jacob4 stand-alone package. We demonstrated its efficiency in delimiting two closely related species of the <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> group.

Despite the progress, the accuracy of predicted structures tends to vary considerably from case to case. Since the utility of computational models depends on their accuracy, reliable estimates of deviation between predicted and native structures are of utmost importance.<h4>Results</h4>For the first time, we present a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) constructed on a Voronoi tessellation of 3D molecular structures. Despite the irregular data domain, our data representation allows us to efficiently introduce both convolution and pooling operations and train the network in an end-to-end fashion without precomputed descriptors. The resultant model, VoroCNN, predicts local qualities of 3D protein folds. The prediction results are competitive to state of the art and superior to the previous 3D CNN architectures built for the same task. We also discuss practical applications of VoroCNN, for example, in recognition of protein binding interfaces.<h4>Availability</h4>The model, data, and evaluation tests are available at https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/vorocnn/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,
33789926,A Novel Three-Choice Touchscreen Task to Examine Spatial Attention and Orienting Responses in Rodents.,"Mammalian orienting behavior consists of coordinated movements of the eyes, head, pinnae, vibrissae, or body to attend to an external stimulus. The present study aimed to develop a novel operant task using a touch-screen system to measure spatial attention. In this task, rats were trained to nose-poke a light stimulus presented in one of three locations. The stimulus was presented more frequently in the center location to develop spatial attention bias toward the center stimulus. Changes in orienting responses were detected by measuring the animals' response accuracy and latency to stimuli at the lateral locations, following reversible unilateral chemogenetic inactivation of the superior colliculus (SC). Additionally, spontaneous turning and rotation behavior was measured using an open-field test (OFT). Our results show that right SC inactivation significantly increased the whole body turn angle in the OFT, in line with previous literature that indicated an ipsiversive orientating bias and the presence of contralateral neglect following unilateral SC lesions. In the touch screen orienting task, unilateral SC inactivation significantly increased bias toward the ipsilateral side, as measured by response frequency in various experimental conditions, and a very large left-shift of a respective psychometric function. Our results demonstrate that this novel touchscreen task is able to detect changes in spatial attention and orienting responses because of e.g. experimental manipulations or injury with very high sensitivity, while taking advantage of the touch screen technology that allows for high transferability of the task between labs and for open-source data sharing through https://www.mousebytes.ca.","hji,kes",0,1,1,2,0.5,,"yes,  not well conveyed in the abstract"

Each <i>concept</i> represents a topologically conserved assembly of helices and strands that make contact. Any protein structure can be dissected into instances of concepts from this dictionary. We dissected the Protein Data Bank and completely inventoried all the concept instances. This yields many insights, including correlations between concepts and catalytic activities or binding sites, useful for rational drug design; local amino-acid sequence-structure correlations, useful for <i>ab initio</i> structure prediction methods; and information supporting the recognition and exploration of evolutionary relationships, useful for structural studies.

These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, comorbidities, genetics and other factors-compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology and potential biomarkers associated with the disease, as they become available. The heterogeneous data pose challenges for efficient extrapolation of information into clinical applications. We have curated 145 COVID-19 biomarkers by developing a novel cross-cutting disease biomarker data model that allows integration and evaluation of biomarkers in patients with comorbidities. Most biomarkers are related to the immune (SAA, TNF-<U+221D> and IP-10) or coagulation (D-dimer, antithrombin and VWF) cascades, suggesting complex vascular pathobiology of the disease. Furthermore, we observe commonality with established cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2) as well as biomarkers for metabolic syndrome and diabetes (CRP, NLR and LDL).

IND607223097,Characterization of transcriptomes from sexual and asexual lineages of a New Zealand snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum),"Understanding the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction is one of the central challenges of evolutionary biology, yet we know very little about how sex influences molecular evolution. The New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum is ideally suited to address this knowledge gap because obligately sexual individuals often coexist with multiple independently derived obligately asexual lineages. This unusual situation allows direct comparisons both between sexual and asexual P. antipodarum and across populations that differ in the relative frequency of sexual individuals. As such, P. antipodarum has received a great deal of attention as a model system for the maintenance of sex in nature and is also used as a model for environmental toxicology and biological invasions. Molecular genetic resources for P. antipodarum will thus be useful to investigators in a variety of biological fields.

26098815,From Ramachandran Maps to Tertiary Structures of Proteins.,"Sequence to structure of proteins is an unsolved problem. A possible coarse grained resolution to this entails specification of all the torsional (F, <U+03A8>) angles along the backbone of the polypeptide chain. The Ramachandran map quite elegantly depicts the allowed conformational (F, <U+03A8>) space of proteins which is still very large for the purposes of accurate structure generation. We have divided the allowed (F, <U+03A8>) space in Ramachandran maps into 27 distinct conformations sufficient to regenerate a structure to within 5  from the native, at least for small proteins, thus reducing the structure prediction problem to a specification of an alphanumeric string, i.e., the amino acid sequence together with one of the 27 conformations preferred by each amino acid residue. This still theoretically results in 27(n) conformations for a protein comprising """"n"""" amino acids. We then investigated the spatial correlations at the two-residue (dipeptide) and three-residue (tripeptide) levels in what may be described as higher order Ramachandran maps, with the premise that the allowed conformational space starts to shrink as we introduce neighborhood effects. We found, for instance, for a tripeptide which potentially can exist in any of the 27(3) """"allowed"""" conformations, three-fourths of these conformations are redundant to the 95% confidence level, suggesting sequence context dependent preferred conformations. We then created a look-up table of preferred conformations at the tripeptide level and correlated them with energetically favorable conformations. We found in particular that Boltzmann probabilities calculated from van der Waals energies for each conformation of tripeptides correlate well with the observed populations in the structural database (the average correlation coefficient is ~0.8). An alpha-numeric string and hence the tertiary structure can be generated for any sequence from the look-up table within minutes on a single processor and to a higher level of accuracy if secondary structure can be specified. We tested the methodology on 100 small proteins, and in 90% of the cases, a structure within 5  is recovered. We thus believe that the method presented here provides the missing link between Ramachandran maps and tertiary structures of proteins. A Web server to convert a tertiary structure to an alphanumeric string and to predict the tertiary structure from the sequence of a protein using the above methodology is created and made freely accessible at http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/proteomics/rm2ts.jsp.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

This study explores the proteomic differences between mild, severe, and critical COVID-19 positive patients to further understand the disease progression, identify proteins associated with disease severity, and identify potential therapeutic targets. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n = 26), severe (n = 9) or critical (n = 24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https://phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/COVID19/ .

Understanding the distribution of conservation levels that constitutes the evolutionary landscape is crucial to distinguishing functional regions from non-functional. Recent evidence suggests that a binary classification of evolutionary rates is inappropriate for this purpose and finds only highly conserved functional elements. Given that the distribution of evolutionary rates is multi-modal, determining the number of modes is of paramount concern. Through simulation, we evaluate the performance of a number of information criterion approaches derived from MCMC simulations in determining the dimension of a model.<h4>Results</h4>We utilize a deviance information criterion (DIC) approximation that is more robust than the approximations from other information criteria, and show our information criteria approximations do not produce superfluous modes when estimating conservation distributions under a variety of circumstances. We analyse the distribution of conservation for a multiple alignment comprising four primate species and mouse, and repeat this on two additional multiple alignments of similar species. We find evidence of six distinct classes of evolutionary rates that appear to be robust to the species used.<h4>Availability</h4>Source code and data are available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477240/changept.zip.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data available but on dropbox
21226895,Shape-based peak identification for ChIP-Seq.,"<h4>Background</h4>The identification of binding targets for proteins using ChIP-Seq has gained popularity as an alternative to ChIP-chip. Sequencing can, in principle, eliminate artifacts associated with microarrays, and cheap sequencing offers the ability to sequence deeply and obtain a comprehensive survey of binding. A number of algorithms have been developed to call """"peaks"""" representing bound regions from mapped reads. Most current algorithms incorporate multiple heuristics, and despite much work it remains difficult to accurately determine individual peaks corresponding to distinct binding events.<h4>Results</h4>Our method for identifying statistically significant peaks from read coverage is inspired by the notion of persistence in topological data analysis and provides a non-parametric approach that is statistically sound and robust to noise in experiments. Specifically, our method reduces the peak calling problem to the study of tree-based statistics derived from the data. We validate our approach using previously published data and show that it can discover previously missed regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The difficulty in accurately calling peaks for ChIP-Seq data is partly due to the difficulty in defining peaks, and we demonstrate a novel method that improves on the accuracy of previous methods in resolving peaks. Our introduction of a robust statistical test based on ideas from topological data analysis is also novel.

Five types of resources were indexed in this system: MEDLINE abstracts, PubMed Central full-text articles, eMedicine documents, clinical guidelines and Wikipedia articles.<h4>Measurement</h4>We compared the AskHERMES system with Google (Google and Google Scholar) and UpToDate and asked physicians to score the three systems by ease of use, quality of answer, time spent, and overall performance.<h4>Results</h4>AskHERMES allows physicians to enter a question in a natural way with minimal query formulation and allows physicians to efficiently navigate among all the answer sentences to quickly meet their information needs. In contrast, physicians need to formulate queries to search for information in Google and UpToDate. The development of the AskHERMES system is still at an early stage, and the knowledge resource is limited compared with Google or UpToDate. Nevertheless, the evaluation results show that AskHERMES' performance is comparable to the other systems. In particular, when answering complex clinical questions, it demonstrates the potential to outperform both Google and UpToDate systems.<h4>Conclusions</h4>AskHERMES, available at http://www.AskHERMES.org, has the potential to help physicians practice evidence-based medicine and improve the quality of patient care.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21266443,An efficient hierarchical generalized linear mixed model for pathway analysis of genome-wide association studies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex diseases, genetic variants having real but weak associations often fail to be detected at the stringent genome-wide significance level. Pathway analysis, which tests disease association with combined association signals from a group of variants in the same pathway, has become increasingly popular. However, because of the complexities in genetic data and the large sample sizes in typical GWAS, pathway analysis remains to be challenging. We propose a new statistical model for pathway analysis of GWAS. This model includes a fixed effects component that models mean disease association for a group of genes, and a random effects component that models how each gene's association with disease varies about the gene group mean, thus belongs to the class of mixed effects models.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed model is computationally efficient and uses only summary statistics. In addition, it corrects for the presence of overlapping genes and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Via simulated and real GWAS data, we showed our model improved power over currently available pathway analysis methods while preserving type I error rate. Furthermore, using the WTCCC Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) dataset, we demonstrated mixed model analysis identified meaningful biological processes that agreed well with previous reports on T1D. Therefore, the proposed methodology provides an efficient statistical modeling framework for systems analysis of GWAS.<h4>Availability</h4>The software code for mixed models analysis is freely available at http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/LilyWang.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21278116,"Predicting breed composition using breed frequencies of 50,000 markers from the US Meat Animal Research Center 2,000 Bull Project.","Knowledge of breed composition can be useful in multiple aspects of cattle production, and can be critical for analyzing the results of whole genome-wide association studies currently being conducted around the world. We examine the feasibility and accuracy of using genotype data from the most prevalent bovine genome-wide association studies platform, the Illumina BovineSNP50 array (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), to estimate breed composition for individual breeds of cattle. First, allele frequencies (of Illumina-defined allele B) of SNP on the array for each of 16 beef cattle breeds were defined by genotyping a large set of more than 2,000 bulls selected in cooperation with the respective breed associations to be representative of their breed. With these breed-specific allele frequencies, the breed compositions of approximately 2,000 two-, three-, and four-way cross (of 8 breeds) cattle produced at the US Meat Animal Research Center were predicted by using a simple multiple regression technique or Mendel (http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/mendel) and their genotypes from the Illumina BovineSNP50 array, and were then compared with pedigree-based estimates of breed composition. The accuracy of marker-based breed composition estimates was 89% when using either estimation method for all breeds except Angus and Red Angus (averaged 79%), based on comparing estimates with pedigree-based average breed composition. Accuracy increased to approximately 88% when these 2 breeds were combined into an aggregate Angus group. Additionally, we used a subset of these markers, approximately 3,000 that populate the Illumina Bovine3K (Illumina Inc.), to see whether breed composition could be estimated with similar accuracy when using this reduced panel of SNP makers. When breed composition was estimated using only SNP in common with the Bovine 3K array, accuracy was slightly reduced to 83%. These results suggest that SNP data from these arrays could be used to estimate breed composition in most US beef cattle in situations where pedigree is not known (e.g., multiple-sire natural service matings, non-source-verified animals in feedlots or at slaughter). This approach can aid analyses that depend on knowledge of breed composition, including identification and adjustment of breed-based population stratification, when performing genome-wide association studies on populations with incomplete pedigrees. In addition, SNP-based breed composition estimates may facilitate fitting cow germplasm to the environment, managing cattle in the feedlot, and tracing disease cases back to the geographic region or farm of origin.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21330288,Sensitive gene fusion detection using ambiguously mapping RNA-Seq read pairs.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Paired-end whole transcriptome sequencing provides evidence for fusion transcripts. However, due to the repetitiveness of the transcriptome, many reads have multiple high-quality mappings. Previous methods to find gene fusions either ignored these reads or required additional longer single reads. This can obscure up to 30% of fusions and unnecessarily discards much of the data.<h4>Results</h4>We present a method for using paired-end reads to find fusion transcripts without requiring unique mappings or additional single read sequencing. Using simulated data and data from tumors and cell lines, we show that our method can find fusions with ambiguously mapping read pairs without generating numerous spurious fusions from the many mapping locations.<h4>Availability</h4>A C++ and Python implementation of the method demonstrated in this article is available at http://exon.ucsd.edu/ShortFuse.<h4>Contact</h4>mckinsel@ucsd.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21345871,BiC: a web server for calculating bimodality of coexpression between gene and protein networks.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Bimodal patterns of expression have recently been shown to be useful not only in prioritizing genes that distinguish phenotypes, but also in prioritizing network models that correlate with proteomic evidence. In particular, subgroups of strongly coexpressed gene pairs result in an increased variance of the correlation distribution. This variance, a measure of association between sets of genes (or proteins), can be summarized as the bimodality of coexpression (BiC). We developed an online tool to calculate the BiC for user-defined gene lists and associated mRNA expression data. BiC is a comprehensive application that provides researchers with the ability to analyze both publicly available and user-collected array data.<h4>Availability</h4>The freely available web service and the documentation can be accessed at http://gurkan.case.edu/software.<h4>Contact</h4>gurkan@case.edu.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21371586,"Preparation of protein samples for NMR structure, function, and small-molecule screening studies.","In this chapter, we concentrate on the production of high-quality protein samples for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. In particular, we provide an in-depth description of recent advances in the production of NMR samples and their synergistic use with recent advancements in NMR hardware. We describe the protein production platform of the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium and outline our high-throughput strategies for producing high-quality protein samples for NMR studies. Our strategy is based on the cloning, expression, and purification of 6-His-tagged proteins using T7-based Escherichia coli systems and isotope enrichment in minimal media. We describe 96-well ligation-independent cloning and analytical expression systems, parallel preparative scale fermentation, and high-throughput purification protocols. The 6-His affinity tag allows for a similar two-step purification procedure implemented in a parallel high-throughput fashion that routinely results in purity levels sufficient for NMR studies (>97% homogeneity). Using this platform, the protein open reading frames of over 17,500 different targeted proteins (or domains) have been cloned as over 28,000 constructs. Nearly 5000 of these proteins have been purified to homogeneity in tens of milligram quantities (see Summary Statistics, http://nesg.org/statistics.html), resulting in more than 950 new protein structures, including more than 400 NMR structures, deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium pipeline has been effective in producing protein samples of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. Although this chapter describes our entire pipeline for producing isotope-enriched protein samples, it focuses on the major updates introduced during the last 5 years (Phase 2 of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Protein Structure Initiative). Our advanced automated and/or parallel cloning, expression, purification, and biophysical screening technologies are suitable for implementation in a large individual laboratory or by a small group of collaborating investigators for structural biology, functional proteomics, ligand screening, and structural genomics research.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21417267,Data-driven high-throughput prediction of the 3-D structure of small molecules: review and progress.,"Accurate prediction of the 3-D structure of small molecules is essential in order to understand their physical, chemical, and biological properties, including how they interact with other molecules. Here, we survey the field of high-throughput methods for 3-D structure prediction and set up new target specifications for the next generation of methods. We then introduce COSMOS, a novel data-driven prediction method that utilizes libraries of fragment and torsion angle parameters. We illustrate COSMOS using parameters extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) by analyzing their distribution and then evaluating the system's performance in terms of speed, coverage, and accuracy. Results show that COSMOS represents a significant improvement when compared to state-of-the-art prediction methods, particularly in terms of coverage of complex molecular structures, including metal-organics. COSMOS can predict structures for 96.4% of the molecules in the CSD (99.6% organic, 94.6% metal-organic), whereas the widely used commercial method CORINA predicts structures for 68.5% (98.5% organic, 51.6% metal-organic). On the common subset of molecules predicted by both methods, COSMOS makes predictions with an average speed per molecule of 0.15 s (0.10 s organic, 0.21 s metal-organic) and an average rmsd of 1.57  (1.26  organic, 1.90  metal-organic), and CORINA makes predictions with an average speed per molecule of 0.13s (0.18s organic, 0.08s metal-organic) and an average rmsd of 1.60  (1.13  organic, 2.11  metal-organic).

21435986,A potential causal association mining algorithm for screening adverse drug reactions in postmarketing surveillance.,"Early detection of unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in postmarketing surveillance saves lives and prevents harmful consequences. We propose a novel data mining approach to signaling potential ADRs from electronic health databases. More specifically, we introduce potential causal association rules (PCARs) to represent the potential causal relationship between a drug and ICD-9 (CDC. (2010). International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). [Online]. Available: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.html) coded signs or symptoms representing potential ADRs. Due to the infrequent nature of ADRs, the existing frequency-based data mining methods cannot effectively discover PCARs. We introduce a new interestingness measure, potential causal leverage, to quantify the degree of association of a PCAR. This measure is based on the computational, experience-based fuzzy recognition-primed decision (RPD) model that we developed previously (Y. Ji, R. M. Massanari, J. Ager, J. Yen, R. E. Miller, and H. Ying, """"A fuzzy logic-based computational recognition-primed decision model,"""" Inf. Sci., vol. 177, pp. 4338-4353, 2007) on the basis of the well-known, psychology-originated qualitative RPD model (G. A. Klein, """"A recognition-primed decision making model of rapid decision making,"""" in Decision Making in Action: Models and Methods, 1993, pp. 138-147). The potential causal leverage assesses the strength of the association of a drug-symptom pair given a collection of patient cases. To test our data mining approach, we retrieved electronic medical data for 16,206 patients treated by one or more than eight drugs of our interest at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit between 2007 and 2009. We selected enalapril as the target drug for this ADR signal generation study. We used our algorithm to preliminarily evaluate the associations between enalapril and all the ICD-9 codes associated with it. The experimental results indicate that our approach has a potential to better signal potential ADRs than risk ratio and leverage, two traditional frequency-based measures. Among the top 50 signal pairs (i.e., enalapril versus symptoms) ranked by the potential causal-leverage measure, the physicians on the project determined that eight of them probably represent true causal associations.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21467251,Patient-specific radiation dose and cancer risk for pediatric chest CT.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To estimate patient-specific radiation dose and cancer risk for pediatric chest computed tomography (CT) and to evaluate factors affecting dose and risk, including patient size, patient age, and scanning parameters.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The institutional review board approved this study and waived informed consent. This study was HIPAA compliant. The study included 30 patients (0-16 years old), for whom full-body computer models were recently created from clinical CT data. A validated Monte Carlo program was used to estimate organ dose from eight chest protocols, representing clinically relevant combinations of bow tie filter, collimation, pitch, and tube potential. Organ dose was used to calculate effective dose and risk index (an index of total cancer incidence risk). The dose and risk estimates before and after normalization by volume-weighted CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) or dose-length product (DLP) were correlated with patient size and age. The effect of each scanning parameter was studied.<h4>Results</h4>Organ dose normalized by tube current-time product or CTDI(vol) decreased exponentially with increasing average chest diameter. Effective dose normalized by tube current-time product or DLP decreased exponentially with increasing chest diameter. Chest diameter was a stronger predictor of dose than weight and total scan length. Risk index normalized by tube current-time product or DLP decreased exponentially with both chest diameter and age. When normalized by DLP, effective dose and risk index were independent of collimation, pitch, and tube potential (<10% variation).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The correlations of dose and risk with patient size and age can be used to estimate patient-specific dose and risk. They can further guide the design and optimization of pediatric chest CT protocols.<h4>Supplemental material</h4>http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101900/-/DC1.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21467568,Increasing power of genome-wide association studies by collecting additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been effectively identifying the genomic regions associated with a disease trait. In a typical GWAS, an informative subset of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), called tag SNPs, is genotyped in case/control individuals. Once the tag SNP statistics are computed, the genomic regions that are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the most significantly associated tag SNPs are believed to contain the causal polymorphisms. However, such LD regions are often large and contain many additional polymorphisms. Following up all the SNPs included in these regions is costly and infeasible for biological validation. In this article we address how to characterize these regions cost effectively with the goal of providing investigators a clear direction for biological validation. We introduce a follow-up study approach for identifying all untyped associated SNPs by selecting additional SNPs, called follow-up SNPs, from the associated regions and genotyping them in the original case/control individuals. We introduce a novel SNP selection method with the goal of maximizing the number of associated SNPs among the chosen follow-up SNPs. We show how the observed statistics of the original tag SNPs and human genetic variation reference data such as the HapMap Project can be utilized to identify the follow-up SNPs. We use simulated and real association studies based on the HapMap data and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium to demonstrate that our method shows superior performance to the correlation- and distance-based traditional follow-up SNP selection approaches. Our method is publicly available at http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/followupSNPs.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21493653,A robust and accurate binning algorithm for metagenomic sequences with arbitrary species abundance ratio.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the rapid development of next-generation sequencing techniques, metagenomics, also known as environmental genomics, has emerged as an exciting research area that enables us to analyze the microbial environment in which we live. An important step for metagenomic data analysis is the identification and taxonomic characterization of DNA fragments (reads or contigs) resulting from sequencing a sample of mixed species. This step is referred to as 'binning'. Binning algorithms that are based on sequence similarity and sequence composition markers rely heavily on the reference genomes of known microorganisms or phylogenetic markers. Due to the limited availability of reference genomes and the bias and low availability of markers, these algorithms may not be applicable in all cases. Unsupervised binning algorithms which can handle fragments from unknown species provide an alternative approach. However, existing unsupervised binning algorithms only work on datasets either with balanced species abundance ratios or rather different abundance ratios, but not both.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we present MetaCluster 3.0, an integrated binning method based on the unsupervised top--down separation and bottom--up merging strategy, which can bin metagenomic fragments of species with very balanced abundance ratios (say 1:1) to very different abundance ratios (e.g. 1:24) with consistently higher accuracy than existing methods.<h4>Availability</h4>MetaCluster 3.0 can be downloaded at http://i.cs.hku.hk/~alse/MetaCluster/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21496265,SNP-based pathway enrichment analysis for genome-wide association studies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recently we have witnessed a surge of interest in using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to discover the genetic basis of complex diseases. Many genetic variations, mostly in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been identified in a wide spectrum of diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and psychiatric diseases. A common theme arising from these studies is that the genetic variations discovered by GWAS can only explain a small fraction of the genetic risks associated with the complex diseases. New strategies and statistical approaches are needed to address this lack of explanation. One such approach is the pathway analysis, which considers the genetic variations underlying a biological pathway, rather than separately as in the traditional GWAS studies. A critical challenge in the pathway analysis is how to combine evidences of association over multiple SNPs within a gene and multiple genes within a pathway. Most current methods choose the most significant SNP from each gene as a representative, ignoring the joint action of multiple SNPs within a gene. This approach leads to preferential identification of genes with a greater number of SNPs.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a SNP-based pathway enrichment method for GWAS studies. The method consists of the following two main steps: 1) for a given pathway, using an adaptive truncated product statistic to identify all representative (potentially more than one) SNPs of each gene, calculating the average number of representative SNPs for the genes, then re-selecting the representative SNPs of genes in the pathway based on this number; and 2) ranking all selected SNPs by the significance of their statistical association with a trait of interest, and testing if the set of SNPs from a particular pathway is significantly enriched with high ranks using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We applied our method to two large genetically distinct GWAS data sets of schizophrenia, one from European-American (EA) and the other from African-American (AA). In the EA data set, we found 22 pathways with nominal P-value less than or equal to 0.001 and corresponding false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5%. In the AA data set, we found 11 pathways by controlling the same nominal P-value and FDR threshold. Interestingly, 8 of these pathways overlap with those found in the EA sample. We have implemented our method in a JAVA software package, called SNP Set Enrichment Analysis (SSEA), which contains a user-friendly interface and is freely available at http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/SSEA.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SNP-based pathway enrichment method described here offers a new alternative approach for analysing GWAS data. By applying it to schizophrenia GWAS studies, we show that our method is able to identify statistically significant pathways, and importantly, pathways that can be replicated in large genetically distinct samples.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21546392,Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE): a web-based RNA alignment tool.,"<h4>Summary</h4>The explosion of interest in non-coding RNAs, together with improvements in RNA X-ray crystallography, has led to a rapid increase in RNA structures at atomic resolution from 847 in 2005 to 1900 in 2010. The success of whole-genome sequencing has led to an explosive growth of unaligned homologous sequences. Consequently, there is a compelling and urgent need for user-friendly tools for producing structure-informed RNA alignments. Most alignment software considers the primary sequence alone; some specialized alignment software can also include Watson-Crick base pairs, but none adequately addresses the needs introduced by the rapid influx of both sequence and structural data. Therefore, we have developed the Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE), which is a web-based RNA alignment editor, designed for editing and assessing alignments using structural information. Some features of BoulderALE include the annotation and evaluation of an alignment based on isostericity of Watson-Crick and non-Watson-Crick base pairs, along with the collapsing (horizontally and vertically) of the alignment, while maintaining the ability to edit the alignment.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.microbio.me/boulderale.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21546400,Mixture models for analysis of the taxonomic composition of metagenomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Inferring the taxonomic profile of a microbial community from a large collection of anonymous DNA sequencing reads is a challenging task in metagenomics. Because existing methods for taxonomic profiling of metagenomes are all based on the assignment of fragmentary sequences to phylogenetic categories, the accuracy of results largely depends on fragment length. This dependence complicates comparative analysis of data originating from different sequencing platforms or resulting from different preprocessing pipelines.<h4>Results</h4>We here introduce a new method for taxonomic profiling based on mixture modeling of the overall oligonucleotide distribution of a sample. Our results indicate that the mixture-based profiles compare well with taxonomic profiles obtained with other methods. However, in contrast to the existing methods, our approach shows a nearly constant profiling accuracy across all kinds of read lengths and it operates at an unrivaled speed.<h4>Availability</h4>A platform-independent implementation of the mixture modeling approach is available in terms of a MATLAB/Octave toolbox at http://gobics.de/peter/taxy.

21554765,Enhancing genome assemblies by integrating non-sequence based data.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Many genome projects were underway before the advent of high-throughput sequencing and have thus been supported by a wealth of genome information from other technologies. Such information frequently takes the form of linkage and physical maps, both of which can provide a substantial amount of data useful in de novo sequencing projects. Furthermore, the recent abundance of genome resources enables the use of conserved synteny maps identified in related species to further enhance genome assemblies.<h4>Methods</h4>The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) is a model marsupial mammal with a low coverage genome. However, we have access to extensive comparative maps containing over 14,000 markers constructed through the physical mapping of conserved loci, chromosome painting and comprehensive linkage maps. Using a custom Bioperl pipeline, information from the maps was aligned to assembled tammar wallaby contigs using BLAT. This data was used to construct pseudo paired-end libraries with intervals ranging from 5-10 MB. We then used Bambus (a program designed to scaffold eukaryotic genomes by ordering and orienting contigs through the use of paired-end data) to scaffold our libraries. To determine how map data compares to sequence based approaches to enhance assemblies, we repeated the experiment using a 0.5 coverage of unique reads from 4 KB and 8 KB Illumina paired-end libraries. Finally, we combined both the sequence and non-sequence-based data to determine how a combined approach could further enhance the quality of the low coverage de novo reconstruction of the tammar wallaby genome.<h4>Results</h4>Using the map data alone, we were able order 2.2% of the initial contigs into scaffolds, and increase the N50 scaffold size to 39 KB (36 KB in the original assembly). Using only the 0.5 paired-end sequence based data, 53% of the initial contigs were assigned to scaffolds. Combining both data sets resulted in a further 2% increase in the number of initial contigs integrated into a scaffold (55% total) but a 35% increase in N50 scaffold size over the use of sequence-based data alone.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We provide a relatively simple pipeline utilizing existing bioinformatics tools to integrate map data into a genome assembly which is available at http://www.mcb.uconn.edu/fac.php?name=paska. While the map data only contributed minimally to assigning the initial contigs to scaffolds in the new assembly, it greatly increased the N50 size. This process added structure to our low coverage assembly, greatly increasing its utility in further analyses.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

21590677,Evaluation of the positional difference between two common geocoding methods.,"Geocoding, the process of matching addresses to geographic coordinates, is a necessary first step when using geographical information systems (GIS) technology. However, different geocoding methodologies can result in different geographic coordinates. The objective of this study was to compare the positional (i.e. longitude/latitude) difference between two common geocoding methods, i.e. ArcGIS (Environmental System Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA) and Batchgeo (freely available online at http://www.batchgeo.com). Address data came from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5-11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programmes located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the USA. Our analyses include baseline addresses (n = 748) collected from the parents of the children in the after school sites. Addresses were first geocoded to the street level and assigned longitude and latitude coordinates with ArcGIS, version 9.3, then the same addresses were geocoded with Batchgeo. For this analysis, the ArcGIS minimum match score was 80. The resulting geocodes were projected into state plane coordinates, and the difference in longitude and latitude coordinates were calculated in meters between the two methods for all data points in each of the four metropolitan areas. We also quantified the descriptions of the geocoding accuracy provided by Batchgeo with the match scores from ArcGIS. We found a 94% match rate (n = 705), 2% (n = 18) were tied and 3% (n = 25) were unmatched using ArcGIS. Forty-eight addresses (6.4%) were not matched in ArcGIS with a match score =80 (therefore only 700 addresses were included in our positional difference analysis). Six hundred thirteen (87.6%) of these addresses had a match score of 100. Batchgeo yielded a 100% match rate for the addresses that ArcGIS geocoded. The median for longitude and latitude coordinates for all the data was just over 25 m. Overall, the range for longitude was 0.04-12,911.8 m, and the range for latitude was 0.02-37,766.6 m. Comparisons show minimal differences in the median and minimum values, while there were slightly larger differences in the maximum values. The majority (>75%) of the geographic differences were within 50 m of each other; mostly <25 m from each other (about 49%). Only about 4% overall were =400 m apart. We also found geographic differences in the proportion of addresses that fell within certain meter ranges. The match-score range associated with the Batchgeo accuracy level """"approximate"""" (least accurate) was 84-100 (mean = 92), while the """"rooftop"""" Batchgeo accuracy level (most accurate) delivered a mean of 98.9 but the range was the same. Although future research should compare the positional difference of Batchgeo to criterion measures of longitude/latitude (e.g. with global positioning system measurement), this study suggests that Batchgeo is a good, free-of-charge option to geocode addresses.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

These guidelines were periodically updated in past years.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the 2009 update of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence (UI).<h4>Evidence acquisition</h4>The EAU working panel was part of the 4th International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) and, with permission of the ICI, extracted the relevant data. The methodology of the 4th ICI was a comprehensive literature review by international experts and consensus formation. In addition, level of evidence was rated according to a modified Oxford system and grades of recommendation were given accordingly.<h4>Evidence summary</h4>A full version of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence is available as a printed document (extended and short form) and as a CD-ROM from the EAU office or online from the EAU Web site (http://www.uroweb.org/guidelines/online-guidelines/). The extent and invasiveness of assessment of UI depends on severity and/or complexity of symptoms and clinical signs and is different for men, women, frail older persons, children, and patients with neuropathy. At the level of initial management, basic diagnostic tests are applied to exclude an underlying disease or condition such as urinary tract infection. Treatment is mostly conservative (lifestyle interventions, physiotherapy, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) and is of an empirical nature. At the level of specialised management (when primary therapy failed, diagnosis is unclear, or symptoms and/or signs are complex/severe),more elaborate assessment is generally required, including imaging, endoscopy, and urodynamics. Treatment options include invasive interventions and surgery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Treatment options for UI are rapidly expanding. These EAU guidelines provide ratings of the evidence (guided by evidence-based medicine) and graded recommendations for the appropriate assessment and according treatment options and put them into clinical perspective.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

As a result of these developments, the analysis of data has become the bottleneck of proteomics experiment. To provide the proteomics community with a user-friendly platform for comprehensive analysis, inspection and visualization of quantitative proteomics data we developed the Graphical Proteomics Data Explorer (GProX)(1). The program requires no special bioinformatics training, as all functions of GProX are accessible within its graphical user-friendly interface which will be intuitive to most users. Basic features facilitate the uncomplicated management and organization of large data sets and complex experimental setups as well as the inspection and graphical plotting of quantitative data. These are complemented by readily available high-level analysis options such as database querying, clustering based on abundance ratios, feature enrichment tests for e.g. GO terms and pathway analysis tools. A number of plotting options for visualization of quantitative proteomics data is available and most analysis functions in GProX create customizable high quality graphical displays in both vector and bitmap formats. The generic import requirements allow data originating from essentially all mass spectrometry platforms, quantitation strategies and software to be analyzed in the program.

By modeling the patterns of linkage disequilibrium in a reference panel, genotypes not directly measured in the study samples can be imputed and used for GWASs. Since millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms need to be imputed in a GWAS, faster methods for genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction are required.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a program package for parallel computation of genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction. Our program package, ParaHaplo 3.0, is intended for use in workstation clusters using the Intel Message Passing Interface. We compared the performance of ParaHaplo 3.0 on the Japanese in Tokyo, Japan and Han Chinese in Beijing, and Chinese in the HapMap dataset. A parallel version of ParaHaplo 3.0 can conduct genotype imputation 20 times faster than a non-parallel version of ParaHaplo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ParaHaplo 3.0 is an invaluable tool for conducting haplotype-based GWASs. The need for faster genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction using parallel computing will become increasingly important as the data sizes of such projects continue to increase. ParaHaplo executable binaries and program sources are available at http://en.sourceforge.jp/projects/parallelgwas/releases/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21624157,How orthogonal are the OBO Foundry ontologies?,"<h4>Background</h4>Ontologies in biomedicine facilitate information integration, data exchange, search and query of biomedical data, and other critical knowledge-intensive tasks. The OBO Foundry is a collaborative effort to establish a set of principles for ontology development with the eventual goal of creating a set of interoperable reference ontologies in the domain of biomedicine. One of the key requirements to achieve this goal is to ensure that ontology developers reuse term definitions that others have already created rather than create their own definitions, thereby making the ontologies orthogonal.<h4>Methods</h4>We used a simple lexical algorithm to analyze the extent to which the set of OBO Foundry candidate ontologies identified from September 2009 to September 2010 conforms to this vision. Specifically, we analyzed (1) the level of explicit term reuse in this set of ontologies, (2) the level of overlap, where two ontologies define similar terms independently, and (3) how the levels of reuse and overlap changed during the course of this year.<h4>Results</h4>We found that 30% of the ontologies reuse terms from other Foundry candidates and 96% of the candidate ontologies contain terms that overlap with terms from the other ontologies. We found that while term reuse increased among the ontologies between September 2009 and September 2010, the level of overlap among the ontologies remained relatively constant. Additionally, we analyzed the six ontologies announced as OBO Foundry members on March 5, 2010, and identified that the level of overlap was extremely low, but, notably, so was the level of term reuse.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have created a prototype web application that allows OBO Foundry ontology developers to see which classes from their ontologies overlap with classes from other ontologies in the OBO Foundry (http://obomap.bioontology.org). From our analysis, we conclude that while the OBO Foundry has made significant progress toward orthogonality during the period of this study through increased adoption of explicit term reuse, a large amount of overlap remains among these ontologies. Furthermore, the characteristics of the identified overlap, such as the terms it comprises and its distribution among the ontologies, indicate that the achieving orthogonality will be exceptionally difficult, if not impossible.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,for analysis only it seems
21685100,Piecewise linear approximation of protein structures using the principle of minimum message length.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Simple and concise representations of protein-folding patterns provide powerful abstractions for visualizations, comparisons, classifications, searching and aligning structural data. Structures are often abstracted by replacing standard secondary structural features-that is, helices and strands of sheet-by vectors or linear segments. Relying solely on standard secondary structure may result in a significant loss of structural information. Further, traditional methods of simplification crucially depend on the consistency and accuracy of external methods to assign secondary structures to protein coordinate data. Although many methods exist automatically to identify secondary structure, the impreciseness of definitions, along with errors and inconsistencies in experimental structure data, drastically limit their applicability to generate reliable simplified representations, especially for structural comparison. This article introduces a mathematically rigorous algorithm to delineate protein structure using the elegant statistical and inductive inference framework of minimum message length (MML). Our method generates consistent and statistically robust piecewise linear explanations of protein coordinate data, resulting in a powerful and concise representation of the structure. The delineation is completely independent of the approaches of using hydrogen-bonding patterns or inspecting local substructural geometry that the current methods use. Indeed, as is common with applications of the MML criterion, this method is free of parameters and thresholds, in striking contrast to the existing programs which are often beset by them. The analysis of results over a large number of proteins suggests that the method produces consistent delineation of structures that encompasses, among others, the segments corresponding to standard secondary structure.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~karun/pmml.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21703007,PlantPhos: using maximal dependence decomposition to identify plant phosphorylation sites with substrate site specificity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial regulatory roles in intracellular signal transduction. Due to the difficulty in performing high-throughput mass spectrometry-based experiment, there is a desire to predict phosphorylation sites using computational methods. However, previous studies regarding in silico prediction of plant phosphorylation sites lack the consideration of kinase-specific phosphorylation data. Thus, we are motivated to propose a new method that investigates different substrate specificities in plant phosphorylation sites.<h4>Results</h4>Experimentally verified phosphorylation data were extracted from TAIR9-a protein database containing 3006 phosphorylation data from the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. In an attempt to investigate the various substrate motifs in plant phosphorylation, maximal dependence decomposition (MDD) is employed to cluster a large set of phosphorylation data into subgroups containing significantly conserved motifs. Profile hidden Markov model (HMM) is then applied to learn a predictive model for each subgroup. Cross-validation evaluation on the MDD-clustered HMMs yields an average accuracy of 82.4% for serine, 78.6% for threonine, and 89.0% for tyrosine models. Moreover, independent test results using Arabidopsis thaliana phosphorylation data from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot show that the proposed models are able to correctly predict 81.4% phosphoserine, 77.1% phosphothreonine, and 83.7% phosphotyrosine sites. Interestingly, several MDD-clustered subgroups are observed to have similar amino acid conservation with the substrate motifs of well-known kinases from Phospho.ELM-a database containing kinase-specific phosphorylation data from multiple organisms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work presents a novel method for identifying plant phosphorylation sites with various substrate motifs. Based on cross-validation and independent testing, results show that the MDD-clustered models outperform models trained without using MDD. The proposed method has been implemented as a web-based plant phosphorylation prediction tool, PlantPhos http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/PlantPhos/. Additionally, two case studies have been demonstrated to further evaluate the effectiveness of PlantPhos.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21708002,A mutation degree model for the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements.,"<h4>Background</h4>Current approaches for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements are mainly via the combination of two properties, the evolutionary conservation and the overrepresentation of functional elements in the promoters of co-regulated genes. Despite the development of many motif detection algorithms, the discovery of conserved motifs in a wide range of phylogenetically related promoters is still a challenge, especially for the short motifs embedded in distantly related gene promoters or very closely related promoters, or in the situation that there are not enough orthologous genes available.<h4>Results</h4>A mutation degree model is proposed and a new word counting method is developed for the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements from a set of co-expressed genes. The new method comprises two parts: 1) identifying overrepresented oligo-nucleotides in promoters of co-expressed genes, 2) estimating the conservation of the oligo-nucleotides in promoters of phylogenetically related genes by the mutation degree model. Compared with the performance of other algorithms, our method shows the advantages of low false positive rate and higher specificity, especially the robustness to noisy data. Applying the method to co-expressed gene sets from Arabidopsis, most of known cis-elements were successfully detected. The tool and example are available at http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/lab/soft/ocw/OCW.html.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The mutation degree model proposed in this paper is adapted to phylogenetic data of different qualities, and to a wide range of evolutionary distances. The new word-counting method based on this model has the advantage of better performance in detecting short sequence of cis-elements from co-expressed genes of eukaryotes and is robust to less complete phylogenetic data.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Thus, the integrative analysis of multiple sources of genomic data and information deepens the resolution and enhances the interpretation of stand-alone high-throughput data. In this note, we present PREDA (Position RElated Data Analysis), an R package for detecting regional variations in genomics data.

21750706,GenExp: an interactive web-based genomic DAS client with client-side data rendering.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) offers a standard protocol for sharing and integrating annotations on biological sequences. There are more than 1000 DAS sources available and the number is steadily increasing. Clients are an essential part of the DAS system and integrate data from several independent sources in order to create a useful representation to the user. While web-based DAS clients exist, most of them do not have direct interaction capabilities such as dragging and zooming with the mouse.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present GenExp, a web based and fully interactive visual DAS client. GenExp is a genome oriented DAS client capable of creating informative representations of genomic data zooming out from base level to complete chromosomes. It proposes a novel approach to genomic data rendering and uses the latest HTML5 web technologies to create the data representation inside the client browser. Thanks to client-side rendering most position changes do not need a network request to the server and so responses to zooming and panning are almost immediate. In GenExp it is possible to explore the genome intuitively moving it with the mouse just like geographical map applications. Additionally, in GenExp it is possible to have more than one data viewer at the same time and to save the current state of the application to revisit it later on.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GenExp is a new interactive web-based client for DAS and addresses some of the short-comings of the existing clients. It uses client-side data rendering techniques resulting in easier genome browsing and exploration.

21751374,MassChroQ: a versatile tool for mass spectrometry quantification.,"Recently, many software tools have been developed to perform quantification in LC-MS analyses. However, most of them are specific to either a quantification strategy (e.g. label-free or isotopic labelling) or a mass-spectrometry system (e.g. high or low resolution). In this context, we have developed MassChroQ (Mass Chromatogram Quantification), a versatile software that performs LC-MS data alignment and peptide quantification by peak area integration on extracted ion chromatograms. MassChroQ is suitable for quantification with or without labelling and is not limited to high-resolution systems. Peptides of interest (for example all the identified peptides) can be determined automatically, or manually by providing targeted m/z and retention time values. It can handle large experiments that include protein or peptide fractionation (as SDS-PAGE, 2-D LC). It is fully configurable. Every processing step is traceable, the produced data are in open standard formats and its modularity allows easy integration into proteomic pipelines. The output results are ready for use in statistical analyses. Evaluation of MassChroQ on complex label-free data obtained from low and high-resolution mass spectrometers showed low CVs for technical reproducibility (1.4%) and high coefficients of correlation to protein quantity (0.98).

21756356,Statistical mutation calling from sequenced overlapping DNA pools in TILLING experiments.,"<h4>Background</h4>TILLING (Targeting induced local lesions IN genomes) is an efficient reverse genetics approach for detecting induced mutations in pools of individuals. Combined with the high-throughput of next-generation sequencing technologies, and the resolving power of overlapping pool design, TILLING provides an efficient and economical platform for functional genomics across thousands of organisms.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a probabilistic method for calling TILLING-induced mutations, and their carriers, from high throughput sequencing data of overlapping population pools, where each individual occurs in two pools. We assign a probability score to each sequence position by applying Bayes' Theorem to a simplified binomial model of sequencing error and expected mutations, taking into account the coverage level. We test the performance of our method on variable quality, high-throughput sequences from wheat and rice mutagenized populations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We show that our method effectively discovers mutations in large populations with sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 99.8%. It also outperforms existing SNP detection methods in detecting real mutations, especially at higher levels of coverage variability across sequenced pools, and in lower quality short reads sequence data.

21779367,High-resolution quantification of focal adhesion spatiotemporal dynamics in living cells.,"Focal adhesions (FAs) are macromolecular complexes that provide a linkage between the cell and its external environment. In a motile cell, focal adhesions change size and position to govern cell migration, through the dynamic processes of assembly and disassembly. To better understand the dynamic regulation of focal adhesions, we have developed an analysis system for the automated detection, tracking, and data extraction of these structures in living cells. This analysis system was used to quantify the dynamics of fluorescently tagged Paxillin and FAK in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts followed via Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRF). High content time series included the size, shape, intensity, and position of every adhesion present in a living cell. These properties were followed over time, revealing adhesion lifetime and turnover rates, and segregation of properties into distinct zones. As a proof-of-concept, we show how a single point mutation in Paxillin at the Jun-kinase phosphorylation site Serine 178 changes FA size, distribution, and rate of assembly. This study provides a detailed, quantitative picture of FA spatiotemporal dynamics as well as a set of tools and methodologies for advancing our understanding of how focal adhesions are dynamically regulated in living cells.

It is indexed by NeuroNames, an ontology designed to compensate for ambiguities in neuroanatomical nomenclature. The 20-year old ontology continues to evolve toward the ideal of recognizing all names of neuroanatomical entities and accommodating all structural concepts about which neuroscientists communicate, including multiple concepts of entities for which neuroanatomists have yet to determine the best or 'true' conceptualization. To make the definitions of structural concepts unambiguous and terminologically consistent we created a 'default vocabulary' of unique structure names selected from existing terminology. We selected standard names by criteria designed to maximize practicality for use in verbal communication as well as computerized knowledge management. The ontology of NeuroNames accommodates synonyms and homonyms of the standard terms in many languages. It defines complex structures as models composed of primary structures, which are defined in unambiguous operational terms. NeuroNames currently relates more than 16,000 names in eight languages to some 2,500 neuroanatomical concepts. The ontology is maintained in a relational database with three core tables: Names, Concepts and Models. BrainInfo uses NeuroNames to index information by structure, to interpret users' queries and to clarify terminology on remote web pages. NeuroNames is a resource vocabulary of the NLM's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS, 2011) and the basis for the brain regions component of NIFSTD (NeuroLex, 2011). The current version has been downloaded to hundreds of laboratories for indexing data and linking to BrainInfo, which attracts some 400 visitors/day, downloading 2,000 pages/day.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
21791534,A dynamic programming algorithm for identification of triplex-forming sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Current methods for identification of potential triplex-forming sequences in genomes and similar sequence sets rely primarily on detecting homopurine and homopyrimidine tracts. Procedures capable of detecting sequences supporting imperfect, but structurally feasible intramolecular triplex structures are needed for better sequence analysis.<h4>Results</h4>We modified an algorithm for detection of approximate palindromes, so as to account for the special nature of triplex DNA structures. From available literature, we conclude that approximate triplexes tolerate two classes of errors. One, analogical to mismatches in duplex DNA, involves nucleotides in triplets that do not readily form Hoogsteen bonds. The other class involves geometrically incompatible neighboring triplets hindering proper alignment of strands for optimal hydrogen bonding and stacking. We tested the statistical properties of the algorithm, as well as its correctness when confronted with known triplex sequences. The proposed algorithm satisfactorily detects sequences with intramolecular triplex-forming potential. Its complexity is directly comparable to palindrome searching.<h4>Availability</h4>Our implementation of the algorithm is available at http://www.fi.muni.cz/lexa/triplex as source code and a web-based search tool.

However, the last and more challenging step is inferring the biological role of the identified proteins through their association with interaction networks, biological pathways, analysis of the effect of post-translational modifications, and other protein-related information.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we present an integrative visualization methodology that allows combining experimentally produced proteomic features with protein meta-features, typically coming from meta-analysis tools and databases, in synthetic Proteomic Feature Maps. Using three proteomics analysis scenarios, we show that the proposed visualization approach is effective in filtering, navigating and interacting with the proteomics data in order to address visually challenging biological questions. The novelty of our approach lies in the ease of integration of any user-defined proteomic features in easy-to-comprehend visual representations that resemble the familiar 2D-gel images, and can be adapted to the user's needs. The main capabilities of the developed VIP software, which implements the presented visualization methodology, are also highlighted and discussed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By using this visualization and the associated VIP software, researchers can explore a complex heterogeneous proteomics dataset from different perspectives in order to address visually important biological queries and formulate new hypotheses for further investigation.

Tagged organism mentions also play a pivotal role in disambiguating other entities in a text, such as proteins. A high-precision organism tagging system must be able to detect the numerous forms of organism mentions, including common names as well as the traditional taxonomic groups: genus, species and strains. In addition, such a system must resolve abbreviations and acronyms, assign the scientific name and if possible link the detected mention to the NCBI Taxonomy database for further semantic queries and literature navigation.<h4>Results</h4>We present the OrganismTagger, a hybrid rule-based/machine learning system to extract organism mentions from the literature. It includes tools for automatically generating lexical and ontological resources from a copy of the NCBI Taxonomy database, thereby facilitating system updates by end users. Its novel ontology-based resources can also be reused in other semantic mining and linked data tasks. Each detected organism mention is normalized to a canonical name through the resolution of acronyms and abbreviations and subsequently grounded with an NCBI Taxonomy database ID. In particular, our system combines a novel machine-learning approach with rule-based and lexical methods for detecting strain mentions in documents.

21846404,Prediction of conformational B-cell epitopes from 3D structures by random forests with a distance-based feature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Antigen-antibody interactions are key events in immune system, which provide important clues to the immune processes and responses. In Antigen-antibody interactions, the specific sites on the antigens that are directly bound by the B-cell produced antibodies are well known as B-cell epitopes. The identification of epitopes is a hot topic in bioinformatics because of their potential use in the epitope-based drug design. Although most B-cell epitopes are discontinuous (or conformational), insufficient effort has been put into the conformational epitope prediction, and the performance of existing methods is far from satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>In order to develop the high-accuracy model, we focus on some possible aspects concerning the prediction performance, including the impact of interior residues, different contributions of adjacent residues, and the imbalanced data which contain much more non-epitope residues than epitope residues. In order to address above issues, we take following strategies. Firstly, a concept of 'thick surface patch' instead of 'surface patch' is introduced to describe the local spatial context of each surface residue, which considers the impact of interior residue. The comparison between the thick surface patch and the surface patch shows that interior residues contribute to the recognition of epitopes. Secondly, statistical significance of the distance distribution difference between non-epitope patches and epitope patches is observed, thus an adjacent residue distance feature is presented, which reflects the unequal contributions of adjacent residues to the location of binding sites. Thirdly, a bootstrapping and voting procedure is adopted to deal with the imbalanced dataset. Based on the above ideas, we propose a new method to identify the B-cell conformational epitopes from 3D structures by combining conventional features and the proposed feature, and the random forest (RF) algorithm is used as the classification engine. The experiments show that our method can predict conformational B-cell epitopes with high accuracy. Evaluated by leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), our method achieves the mean AUC value of 0.633 for the benchmark bound dataset, and the mean AUC value of 0.654 for the benchmark unbound dataset. When compared with the state-of-the-art prediction models in the independent test, our method demonstrates comparable or better performance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our method is demonstrated to be effective for the prediction of conformational epitopes.

21857117,Eu-Detect: an algorithm for detecting eukaryotic sequences in metagenomic data sets.,"Physical partitioning techniques are routinely employed (during sample preparation stage) for segregating the prokaryotic and eukaryotic fractions of metagenomic samples. In spite of these efforts, several metagenomic studies focusing on bacterial and archaeal populations have reported the presence of contaminating eukaryotic sequences in metagenomic data sets. Contaminating sequences originate not only from genomes of micro-eukaryotic species but also from genomes of (higher) eukaryotic host cells. The latter scenario usually occurs in the case of host-associated metagenomes. Identification and removal of contaminating sequences is important, since these sequences not only impact estimates of microbial diversity but also affect the accuracy of several downstream analyses. Currently, the computational techniques used for identifying contaminating eukaryotic sequences, being alignment based, are slow, inefficient, and require huge computing resources. In this article, we present Eu-Detect, an alignment-free algorithm that can rapidly identify eukaryotic sequences contaminating metagenomic data sets. Validation results indicate that on a desktop with modest hardware specifications, the Eu-Detect algorithm is able to rapidly segregate DNA sequence fragments of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin, with high sensitivity.

21873327,Finding recurrent copy number alterations preserving within-sample homogeneity.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Copy number alterations (CNAs) represent an important component of genetic variation and play a significant role in many human diseases. Development of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technology has made it possible to identify CNAs. Identification of recurrent CNAs represents the first fundamental step to provide a list of genomic regions which form the basis for further biological investigations. The main problem in recurrent CNAs discovery is related to the need to distinguish between functional changes and random events without pathological relevance. Within-sample homogeneity represents a common feature of copy number profile in cancer, so it can be used as additional source of information to increase the accuracy of the results. Although several algorithms aimed at the identification of recurrent CNAs have been proposed, no attempt of a comprehensive comparison of different approaches has yet been published.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a new approach, called Genomic Analysis of Important Alterations (GAIA), to find recurrent CNAs where a statistical hypothesis framework is extended to take into account within-sample homogeneity. Statistical significance and within-sample homogeneity are combined into an iterative procedure to extract the regions that likely are involved in functional changes. Results show that GAIA represents a valid alternative to other proposed approaches. In addition, we perform an accurate comparison by using two real aCGH datasets and a carefully planned simulation study.<h4>Availability</h4>GAIA has been implemented as R/Bioconductor package.

Statistical approaches including correlation analyses in coexpression studies of gene expression have emerged as tools to elucidate gene function using these data sets. Here, we present a powerful and novel alternative methodology to computationally identify functional relationships between genes from microarray data sets using rule-based machine learning. This approach, termed """"coprediction,"""" is based on the collective ability of groups of genes co-occurring within rules to accurately predict the developmental outcome of a biological system. We demonstrate the utility of coprediction as a powerful analytical tool using publicly available microarray data generated exclusively from Arabidopsis thaliana seeds to compute a functional gene interaction network, termed Seed Co-Prediction Network (SCoPNet). SCoPNet predicts functional associations between genes acting in the same developmental and signal transduction pathways irrespective of the similarity in their respective gene expression patterns. Using SCoPNet, we identified four novel regulators of seed germination (ALTERED SEED GERMINATION5, 6, 7, and 8), and predicted interactions at the level of transcript abundance between these novel and previously described factors influencing Arabidopsis seed germination.

21903624,Finding stable local optimal RNA secondary structures.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Many RNAs, such as riboswitches, can fold into multiple alternate structures and perform different biological functions. These biologically functional structures usually have low free energies in their local energy landscapes and are very stable such that they cannot easily jump out of the current states and fold into other stable conformations. The conformational space of feasible RNA secondary structures is prohibitively large, and accurate prediction of functional structure conformations is challenging. Because the stability of an RNA secondary structure is determined predominantly by energetically favorable helical regions (stacks), we propose to use configurations of putative stacks to represent RNA secondary structures. By considering a reduced conformational space of local optimal stack configurations instead of all feasible RNA structures, we first present an algorithm for enumerating all possible local optimal stack configurations. In addition, we present a fast heuristic algorithm for approximating energy barriers encountered during folding pathways between each pair of local optimal stack configurations and finding all the stable local optimal structures.<h4>Results</h4>Benchmark tests have been conducted on several RNA riboswitches, whose alternate secondary structures have been experimentally verified. The benchmark results show that our method can successfully predict the native 'on' and 'off' secondary structures, and better rank them compared with other state-of-art approaches.<h4>Availability</h4>The software is freely available and can be downloaded at http://genome.ucf.edu/RNASLOpt.<h4>Contact</h4>shzhang@eecs.ucf.edu.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

A recent benchmark of binding affinities has allowed, for the first time, the evaluation and construction of binding free energy models using a diverse set of complexes, and a systematic assessment of our ability to model the energetics of conformational changes.<h4>Results</h4>We construct a large set of molecular descriptors using commonly available tools, introducing the use of energetic factors associated with conformational changes and disorder to order transitions, as well as features calculated on structural ensembles. The descriptors are used to train and test a binding free energy model using a consensus of four machine learning algorithms, whose performance constitutes a significant improvement over the other state of the art empirical free energy functions tested.

CBS accurately segments data by detecting change-points using a maximal-t test; but extensive computational burden is involved for evaluating the significance of change-points using permutations. A recent implementation utilizing a hybrid method and early stopping rules (hybrid CBS) to improve the performance in speed was subsequently proposed. However, a time analysis revealed that a major portion of computation time of the hybrid CBS was still spent on permutation. In addition, what the hybrid method provides is an approximation of the significance upper bound or lower bound, not an approximation of the significance of change-points itself.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a novel model-based algorithm, extreme-value based CBS (eCBS), which limits permutations and provides robust results without loss of accuracy. Thousands of aCGH data under null hypothesis were simulated in advance based on a variety of non-normal assumptions, and the corresponding maximal-t distribution was modeled by the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The modeling results, which associate characteristics of aCGH data to the GEV parameters, constitute lookup tables (eXtreme model). Using the eXtreme model, the significance of change-points could be evaluated in a constant time complexity through a table lookup process.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel algorithm, eCBS, was developed in this study. The current implementation of eCBS consistently outperforms the hybrid CBS 4 to 20 in computation time without loss of accuracy.

21988420,"Pain, analgesia and genetics.","<h4>Objectives</h4>In the clinical setting, there is marked intersubject variability in the intensity of pain reported by patients with apparently similar pain states, as well as widely differing analgesic dosing requirements between individuals to produce satisfactory pain relief with tolerable side-effects. Genetic and environmental factors as well as their interaction are implicated, and these are discussed in this review.<h4>Key findings</h4>Pioneering work undertaken in mice more than a decade ago, showed a strong genetic contribution to levels of nociception/hypersensitivity as well as levels of antinociception produced by commonly available analgesic agents. To date more than 300 candidate 'pain' genes have been identified as potentially contributing to heritable differences in pain sensitivity and analgesic responsiveness in animals and humans, with this information available in a publicly accessible database http://www.jbldesign.com/jmogil/enter.html. Since then, many genetic association studies have been conducted in humans to investigate the possibility that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an individual gene may explain drug inefficacy or excessive toxicity experienced by a small subset of the whole population who have the rare allele for a particular SNP.<h4>Summary</h4>Despite the fact that SNPs in more than 20 genes that affect pain sensitivity or contribute to interindividual variability in responses to analgesic medications have been identified in the human genome, much of the data is conflicting. Apart from deficiencies in the design and conduct of human genetic association studies, recent research from other fields has implicated epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate dynamic gene-environment communication, as a possible explanation.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not about the resource

We study the scaffolding phase of sequence assembly where preassembled contigs are ordered based on mate pair data.<h4>Results</h4>We present MIP Scaffolder that divides the scaffolding problem into smaller subproblems and solves these with mixed integer programming. The scaffolding problem can be represented as a graph and the biconnected components of this graph can be solved independently. We present a technique for restricting the size of these subproblems so that they can be solved accurately with mixed integer programming. We compare MIP Scaffolder to two state of the art methods, SOPRA and SSPACE.

For this reason, it is important to be able to identify instances of data production and deposition for potential re-use. Herein, we report on the automatic identification of data deposition statements in research articles.<h4>Results</h4>We apply machine learning algorithms to sentences extracted from full-text articles in PubMed Central in order to automatically determine whether a given article contains a data deposition statement, and retrieve the specific statements. With an Support Vector Machine classifier using conditional random field determined deposition features, articles containing deposition statements are correctly identified with 81% F-measure. An error analysis shows that almost half of the articles classified as containing a deposition statement by our method but not by the gold standard do indeed contain a deposition statement. In addition, our system was used to process articles in PubMed Central, predicting that a total of 52 932 articles report data deposition, many of which are not currently included in the Secondary Source Identifier [si] field for MEDLINE citations.<h4>Availability</h4>All annotated datasets described in this study are freely available from the NLM/NCBI website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Fellows/Neveol/DepositionDataSets.zip<h4>Contact</h4>aurelie.neveol@nih.gov; john.wilbur@nih.gov; zhiyong.lu@nih.gov<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,zip
22014078,"Inputs to quality: supervision, management, and community involvement in health facilities in Egypt in 2004.","<h4>Background</h4>As low- and middle-income countries experience economic development, ensuring quality of health care delivery is a central component of health reform. Nevertheless, health reforms in low- and middle-income countries have focused more on access to services rather than the quality of these services, and reporting on quality has been limited. In the present study, we sought to examine the prevalence and regional variation in key management practices in Egyptian health facilities within three domains: supervision of the facility from the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), managerial processes, and patient and community involvement in care.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 559 facilities surveyed with the Egyptian Service Provision Assessment (ESPA) survey in 2004, the most recent such survey in Egypt. We registered on the Measure Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) website http://legacy.measuredhs.com/login.cfm to gain access to the survey data. From the ESPA sampled 559 MOHP facilities, we excluded a total of 79 facilities because they did not offer facility-based 24-hour care or have at least one physician working in the facility, resulting in a final sample of 480 facilities. The final sample included 76 general service hospitals, 307 rural health units, and 97 maternal and child health and urban health units (MCH/urban units). We used standard frequency analyses to describe facility characteristics and tested the statistical significance of regional differences using chi-square statistics.<h4>Results</h4>Nearly all facilities reported having external supervision within the 6 months preceding the interview. In contrast, key facility-level managerial processes, such as having routine and documented management meetings and applying quality assurance approaches, were uncommon. Involvement of communities and patients was also reported in a minority of facilities. Hospitals and health units located in Urban Egypt compared with more rural parts of Egypt were significantly more likely to have management committees that met at least monthly, to keep official records of the meetings, and to have an approach for reviewing quality assurance activities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although the data precede the recent reform efforts of the MOHP, they provide a baseline against which future progress can be measured. Targeted efforts to improve facility-level management are critical to supporting quality improvement initiatives directed at improving the quality of health care throughout the country.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
22014236,An integrated workflow for robust alignment and simplified quantitative analysis of NMR spectrometry data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful technique to reveal and compare quantitative metabolic profiles of biological tissues. However, chemical and physical sample variations make the analysis of the data challenging, and typically require the application of a number of preprocessing steps prior to data interpretation. For example, noise reduction, normalization, baseline correction, peak picking, spectrum alignment and statistical analysis are indispensable components in any NMR analysis pipeline.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a novel suite of informatics tools for the quantitative analysis of NMR metabolomic profile data. The core of the processing cascade is a novel peak alignment algorithm, called hierarchical Cluster-based Peak Alignment (CluPA). The algorithm aligns a target spectrum to the reference spectrum in a top-down fashion by building a hierarchical cluster tree from peak lists of reference and target spectra and then dividing the spectra into smaller segments based on the most distant clusters of the tree. To reduce the computational time to estimate the spectral misalignment, the method makes use of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) cross-correlation. Since the method returns a high-quality alignment, we can propose a simple methodology to study the variability of the NMR spectra. For each aligned NMR data point the ratio of the between-group and within-group sum of squares (BW-ratio) is calculated to quantify the difference in variability between and within predefined groups of NMR spectra. This differential analysis is related to the calculation of the F-statistic or a one-way ANOVA, but without distributional assumptions. Statistical inference based on the BW-ratio is achieved by bootstrapping the null distribution from the experimental data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The workflow performance was evaluated using a previously published dataset. Correlation maps, spectral and grey scale plots show clear improvements in comparison to other methods, and the down-to-earth quantitative analysis works well for the CluPA-aligned spectra. The whole workflow is embedded into a modular and statistically sound framework that is implemented as an R package called """"speaq"""" (""""spectrum alignment and quantitation""""), which is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/speaq/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

22088842,Dragon PolyA Spotter: predictor of poly(A) motifs within human genomic DNA sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Recognition of poly(A) signals in mRNA is relatively straightforward due to the presence of easily recognizable polyadenylic acid tail. However, the task of identifying poly(A) motifs in the primary genomic DNA sequence that correspond to poly(A) signals in mRNA is a far more challenging problem. Recognition of poly(A) signals is important for better gene annotation and understanding of the gene regulation mechanisms. In this work, we present one such poly(A) motif prediction method based on properties of human genomic DNA sequence surrounding a poly(A) motif. These properties include thermodynamic, physico-chemical and statistical characteristics. For predictions, we developed Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest models. These models are trained to recognize 12 most common poly(A) motifs in human DNA. Our predictors are available as a free web-based tool accessible at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dps. Compared with other reported predictors, our models achieve higher sensitivity and specificity and furthermore provide a consistent level of accuracy for 12 poly(A) motif variants.<h4>Contact</h4>vladimir.bajic@kaust.edu.sa<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

22161415,Surgical orbital decompression for thyroid eye disease.,"<h4>Background</h4>Orbital decompression is an established procedure for the management of exophthalmos and visual rehabilitation from optic neuropathy in cases of thyroid eye disease. Numerous procedures for removal of orbital bony wall, fat or a combination of these for a variety of indications in different stages of the disease have been well reported in the medical literature. However, the relative effectiveness and safety of these procedures in relation to the various indications remains unclear.<h4>Objectives</h4>To review current published evidence for the effectiveness of surgical orbital decompression for disfiguring proptosis in adult thyroid eye disease and summa rise information on possible complications and the quality of life from the studies identified.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1950 to October 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2011), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) and ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 6 October 2011. We searched oculoplastic textbooks, conference proceedings from the European and American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (ESOPRS, ASOPRS), European Ophthalmological Society (SOE), the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) and American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) for the years 2000 to 2009 to identify relevant data. We attempted to contact researchers who are active in this field for information about further published or unpublished studies.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no restriction on date or language comparing two or more surgical methods for orbital decompression with removal of bony wall, orbital fat or a combination of both for disfiguring proptosis or comparison of surgical techniques with any form of medical decompression.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Each review author independently assessed study abstracts identified from the electronic and manual searches. Author analysis was then compared and full papers for appropriate studies were obtained according to the inclusion criteria. Disagreements between the authors were resolved by discussion.<h4>Main results</h4>We identified two randomised trials eligible for inclusion in the review. There was significant variability between the trials for interventions, methodology and outcome measures and therefore meta-analysis was not performed. One study suggested that the transantral approach and endoscopic transnasal technique had similar effects in reducing exophthalmos but that the endoscopic approach may be safer, relating to fewer complications. This study had short-term follow-up and lacked information on our primary outcome (success or failure of treatment). The second study provided evidence that intravenous steroids may be superior to primary surgical decompression in the management of compressive optic neuropathy requiring less secondary surgical procedures, although it relates more frequently to transient side effects. This study was weakened by a small sample size. Until more credible evidence is available recommendations as to best treatment cannot be reliably made.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>A single study showed that the transantral approach for orbital decompression was related to more complications than the endoscopic transnasal technique which is preferred by Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeons, usually as an adjunctive procedure. Intravenous steroids were reported in a single trial to be the most efficient intervention for dysthyroid optic neuropathy. The majority of published literature on orbital decompression for thyroid eye disease consists of retrospective, cohort, or case series studies. Although these provide useful descriptive information, clarification is required to show the relative effectiveness of each intervention for various indications.The two RCTs reviewed are not robust enough to provide credible evidence to our understanding of current decompressive surgery and to support recommendations for clinical practice. There is evidence from currently available uncontrolled studies that removal of the medial and lateral wall (balanced decompression) with or without fat removal may be the most effective surgical method related to only a few complications.There is a clear need for randomised studies evaluating the balanced two-wall, three-wall and orbital fat decompression techniques. Comparison with other surgical techniques for orbital decompression or with immunosuppression in cases of compressive optic neuropathy would also be important. These studies should primarily address the reduction of exophthalmos, disease severity, complication rates, quality of life and cost of the intervention.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

H. vitripennis is highly polyphagous and voracious, feeding on at least 100 plant species and consuming up to 100 times its weight in xylem fluid daily. The insect is a vector of the phytopathogen Xylella fastidiosa (Wells), which is the causative agent of Pierce's disease in grapevines. To evaluate the microbial flora associated with H. vitripennis, total DNA extracts from hemolymph, alimentary canal excretions, and whole insect bodies were subjected to 16S rDNA pyrosequencing using the bTEFAP methodology and the resulting sequences (370-520 bp in length) were compared with a curated high quality 16S database derived from GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Species from the genera Wolbachia, Delftia (formerly Pseudomonas), Pectobacterium, Moraxella, Serratia, Bacillus, and many others were detected and a comprehensive picture of the microbiome associated with H. vitripennis was established. Some of the bacteria identified in this report are initial discoveries; providing a breadth of knowledge to the microbial flora of this insect pest can serve as a reservoir of information for developing biological control strategies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource

22280360,The EnzymeTracker: an open-source laboratory information management system for sample tracking.,"<h4>Background</h4>In many laboratories, researchers store experimental data on their own workstation using spreadsheets. However, this approach poses a number of problems, ranging from sharing issues to inefficient data-mining. Standard spreadsheets are also error-prone, as data do not undergo any validation process. To overcome spreadsheets inherent limitations, a number of proprietary systems have been developed, which laboratories need to pay expensive license fees for. Those costs are usually prohibitive for most laboratories and prevent scientists from benefiting from more sophisticated data management systems.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we propose the EnzymeTracker, a web-based laboratory information management system for sample tracking, as an open-source and flexible alternative that aims at facilitating entry, mining and sharing of experimental biological data. The EnzymeTracker features online spreadsheets and tools for monitoring numerous experiments conducted by several collaborators to identify and characterize samples. It also provides libraries of shared data such as protocols, and administration tools for data access control using OpenID and user/team management. Our system relies on a database management system for efficient data indexing and management and a user-friendly AJAX interface that can be accessed over the Internet. The EnzymeTracker facilitates data entry by dynamically suggesting entries and providing smart data-mining tools to effectively retrieve data. Our system features a number of tools to visualize and annotate experimental data, and export highly customizable reports. It also supports QR matrix barcoding to facilitate sample tracking.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The EnzymeTracker was designed to be easy to use and offers many benefits over spreadsheets, thus presenting the characteristics required to facilitate acceptance by the scientific community.

22303397,Accurate microRNA Target Prediction Using Detailed Binding Site Accessibility and Machine Learning on Proteomics Data.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory genes regulating gene expression by targeting messenger RNA. Though computational methods for miRNA target prediction are the prevailing means to analyze their function, they still miss a large fraction of the targeted genes and additionally predict a large number of false positives. Here we introduce a novel algorithm called DIANA-microT-ANN which combines multiple novel target site features through an artificial neural network (ANN) and is trained using recently published high-throughput data measuring the change of protein levels after miRNA overexpression, providing positive and negative targeting examples. The features characterizing each miRNA recognition element include binding structure, conservation level, and a specific profile of structural accessibility. The ANN is trained to integrate the features of each recognition element along the 3'untranslated region into a targeting score, reproducing the relative repression fold change of the protein. Tested on two different sets the algorithm outperforms other widely used algorithms and also predicts a significant number of unique and reliable targets not predicted by the other methods. For 542 human miRNAs DIANA-microT-ANN predicts 120000 targets not provided by TargetScan 5.0. The algorithm is freely available at http://microrna.gr/microT-ANN.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Previous studies, mostly in non-Caucasian populations, suggest that p53 mutations may be involved. To substantiate this, we performed DNA sequence analysis of exons 4-8 of the p53 gene and immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein in archived keloidal tissue samples from 23 Caucasian patients. In contrast to previous reports, we found mutated p53 in keloidal tissue in a minority of cases (2/23; 12%). The G allele frequency and C allele frequency at the p53 polymorphic codon 72 were 0.72 (33/46) and 0.28 (13/46), respectively, in our study, a finding that was similar to the 0.77 (184/240) vs. 0.23 (56/240) (P = 0.4580; chi-squared test) observed in the Hap Map data of a European population but statistically significantly different from the 0.43 (547/1258) vs. 0.57 (711/1258) (P = 0.0002; chi-squared test) observed in the 1000 Genome project [Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP). Bethesda (MD): National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine. dbSNP accession:rs1042522, (dbSNP Build ID: 132). Available from: (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/] a difference most likely due to the different genetic background of the populations enrolled. However, one-third of the keloidal samples showed lesional nuclear p53 staining with a UV penetration gradient-like positivity (P = 0.0084). Staining with an anti-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer antibody revealed the total absence of short-term photoproducts in the epidermis as well as keloidal tissue. Furthermore, all fibroblasts expressing p53 stained negative for Ki-67, indicating that these cells were in a quiescent stage and p53 upregulation did not contribute to keloidal proliferation. We conclude that p53 plays no major role in the pathogenesis of keloids in the Caucasian population.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource

The method utilizes the z-score value of the distance measure in the feature vector space to estimate the relative contribution among the k-nearest neighbors for prediction of the discrete and continuous solvent accessibility. The Solvent accessibility database is constructed from 5717 proteins extracted from PISCES culling server with the cutoff of 25% sequence identities. Using optimal parameters, the prediction accuracies (for discrete predictions) of 78.38% (two-state prediction with the threshold of 25%), 65.1% (three-state prediction with the thresholds of 9 and 36%), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (between the predicted and true RSA's for continuous prediction) of 0.676 are achieved An independent benchmark test was performed with the CASP8 targets where we find that the proposed method outperforms existing methods. The prediction accuracies are 80.89% (for two state prediction with the threshold of 25%), 67.58% (three-state prediction), and the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.727 (for continuous prediction) with mean absolute error of 0.148.

Additionally Paint4Net functionality can be used to: (1) get lists of involved metabolites and dead end metabolites of the visualized part of the network, (2) exclude (filter) particular metabolites from representation, (3) find isolated parts of a network and (4) find running cycles when all the substrates are cut down. Layout pictures can be saved in various formats and easily distributed. The Paint4Net is open source software under the GPL v3 license. Relevant documentation and sample data is available at http://www.biosystems.lv/paint4net. The Paint4Net works on MATLAB starting from version of 2009.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
22454131,Revealing mammalian evolutionary relationships by comparative analysis of gene clusters.,"Many software tools for comparative analysis of genomic sequence data have been released in recent decades. Despite this, it remains challenging to determine evolutionary relationships in gene clusters due to their complex histories involving duplications, deletions, inversions, and conversions. One concept describing these relationships is orthology. Orthologs derive from a common ancestor by speciation, in contrast to paralogs, which derive from duplication. Discriminating orthologs from paralogs is a necessary step in most multispecies sequence analyses, but doing so accurately is impeded by the occurrence of gene conversion events. We propose a refined method of orthology assignment based on two paradigms for interpreting its definition: by genomic context or by sequence content. X-orthology (based on context) traces orthology resulting from speciation and duplication only, while N-orthology (based on content) includes the influence of conversion events. We developed a computational method for automatically mapping both types of orthology on a per-nucleotide basis in gene cluster regions studied by comparative sequencing, and we make this mapping accessible by visualizing the output. All of these steps are incorporated into our newly extended CHAP 2 package. We evaluate our method using both simulated data and real gene clusters (including the well-characterized a-globin and -globin clusters). We also illustrate use of CHAP 2 by analyzing four more loci: CCL (chemokine ligand), IFN (interferon), CYP2abf (part of cytochrome P450 family 2), and KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors). These new methods facilitate and extend our understanding of evolution at these and other loci by adding automated accurate evolutionary inference to the biologist's toolkit.

22479706,Network-based functional enrichment.,"<h4>Background</h4>Many methods have been developed to infer and reason about molecular interaction networks. These approaches often yield networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes and up to an order of magnitude more edges. It is often desirable to summarize the biological information in such networks. A very common approach is to use gene function enrichment analysis for this task. A major drawback of this method is that it ignores information about the edges in the network being analyzed, i.e., it treats the network simply as a set of genes. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for functional enrichment that explicitly takes network interactions into account.<h4>Results</h4>Our approach naturally generalizes Fisher's exact test, a gene set-based technique. Given a function of interest, we compute the subgraph of the network induced by genes annotated to this function. We use the sequence of sizes of the connected components of this sub-network to estimate its connectivity. We estimate the statistical significance of the connectivity empirically by a permutation test. We present three applications of our method: i) determine which functions are enriched in a given network, ii) given a network and an interesting subnetwork of genes within that network, determine which functions are enriched in the sub-network, and iii) given two networks, determine the functions for which the connectivity improves when we merge the second network into the first. Through these applications, we show that our approach is a natural alternative to network clustering algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We presented a novel approach to functional enrichment that takes into account the pairwise relationships among genes annotated by a particular function. Each of the three applications discovers highly relevant functions. We used our methods to study biological data from three different organisms. Our results demonstrate the wide applicability of our methods. Our algorithms are implemented in C++ and are freely available under the GNU General Public License at our supplementary website.

The INHAND Project (International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice) is a joint initiative of four major societies of toxicologic pathology to develop a globally recognized nomenclature for proliferative and nonproliferative lesions in rodents. This article recommends standardized terms for classifying changes observed in tissues of the mouse and rat central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. Sources of material include academic, government, and industrial histopathology databases from around the world. Covered lesions include frequent, spontaneous, and aging-related changes as well as principal toxicant-induced findings.

22638579,SteinerNet: a web server for integrating 'omic' data to discover hidden components of response pathways.,"High-throughput technologies including transcriptional profiling, proteomics and reverse genetics screens provide detailed molecular descriptions of cellular responses to perturbations. However, it is difficult to integrate these diverse data to reconstruct biologically meaningful signaling networks. Previously, we have established a framework for integrating transcriptional, proteomic and interactome data by searching for the solution to the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem. Here, we present a web server, SteinerNet, to make this method available in a user-friendly format for a broad range of users with data from any species. At a minimum, a user only needs to provide a set of experimentally detected proteins and/or genes and the server will search for connections among these data from the provided interactomes for yeast, human, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. More advanced users can upload their own interactome data as well. The server provides interactive visualization of the resulting optimal network and downloadable files detailing the analysis and results. We believe that SteinerNet will be useful for researchers who would like to integrate their high-throughput data for a specific condition or cellular response and to find biologically meaningful pathways.

22638583,"Seq2Logo: a method for construction and visualization of amino acid binding motifs and sequence profiles including sequence weighting, pseudo counts and two-sided representation of amino acid enrichment and depletion.","Seq2Logo is a web-based sequence logo generator. Sequence logos are a graphical representation of the information content stored in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and provide a compact and highly intuitive representation of the position-specific amino acid composition of binding motifs, active sites, etc. in biological sequences. Accurate generation of sequence logos is often compromised by sequence redundancy and low number of observations. Moreover, most methods available for sequence logo generation focus on displaying the position-specific enrichment of amino acids, discarding the equally valuable information related to amino acid depletion. Seq2logo aims at resolving these issues allowing the user to include sequence weighting to correct for data redundancy, pseudo counts to correct for low number of observations and different logotype representations each capturing different aspects related to amino acid enrichment and depletion. Besides allowing input in the format of peptides and MSA, Seq2Logo accepts input as Blast sequence profiles, providing easy access for non-expert end-users to characterize and identify functionally conserved/variable amino acids in any given protein of interest. The output from the server is a sequence logo and a PSSM. Seq2Logo is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/biotools/Seq2Logo (14 May 2012, date last accessed).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

This technical concern introduces biases that hamper any synthetic studies or comparison of genetic diversity between collections. To prevent this for Sorghum bicolor, we developed a control kit of 48 SSR markers.<h4>Methods and results</h4>One hundred seventeen markers were selected along the genome to provide coverage across the length of all 10 sorghum linkage groups. They were tested for polymorphism and reproducibility across two laboratories (Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement [CIRAD], France, and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics [ICRISAT], India) using two commonly used genotyping technologies (polyacrylamide gel-based technology with LI-COR sequencing machines and capillary systems with ABI sequencing apparatus) with DNA samples from a diverse set of 48 S. bicolor accessions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A kit for diversity analysis (http://sat.cirad.fr/sat/sorghum_SSR_kit/) was developed. It contains information on 48 technically robust sorghum microsatellite markers and 10 DNA controls. It can further be used to calibrate sorghum SSR genotyping data acquired with different technologies and compare those to genetic diversity references.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The dChip-GemiNI (Gene and miRNA Network-based Integration) method statistically ranks computationally predicted FFLs by their explanatory power to account for differential gene and miRNA expression between two biological conditions such as normal and cancer. GemiNI integrates not only gene and miRNA expression data but also computationally derived information about TF-target gene and miRNA-mRNA interactions. Literature validation shows that the integrated modeling of expression data and FFLs better identifies cancer-related TFs and miRNAs compared to existing approaches. We have utilized GemiNI for analyzing six data sets of solid cancers (liver, kidney, prostate, lung and germ cell) and found that top-ranked FFLs account for ~20% of transcriptome changes between normal and cancer. We have identified common FFL regulators across multiple cancer types, such as known FFLs consisting of MYC and miR-15/miR-17 families, and novel FFLs consisting of ARNT, CREB1 and their miRNA partners.

22659403,Determining pair distance distribution function from SAXS data using parametric functionals.,"Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments are widely applied in structural biology. The SAXS experiments yield one-dimensional profile that needs further analysis to reveal structural information. The pair distance distribution function (PDDF), P(r), can provide molecular structures more intuitively, and it can be used to guide ab initio model reconstructions, making it a critical step to derive P(r) from experimental SAXS profiles. To calculate the P(r) curves, a new method based on a specially designed parametric functional form is developed, and implemented in pregxs. This method is tested against both synthetic and experimental data, the estimated P(r) functions are in good agreement with correct or known P(r). The method can also predict the molecular size. In summary, the pregxs method is robust and accurate in P(r) determination from SAXS profiles.

22672126,"Trends in midwife-attended births in the United States, 1989-2009.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Data on attendance at birth by midwives in the United States have been available on the national level since 1989. Rates of certified nurse-midwife (CNM)-attended births more than doubled between 1989 (3.3% of all births) and 2002 (7.7%) and have remained steady since. This article examines trends in midwife-attended births from 1989 to 2009.<h4>Methods</h4>The data in this report are based on records gathered as part of the US National Standard Certificate of Live Birth from a public use Web site, Vital Stats (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/VitalStats.htm), that allows users to create and download specialized tables.<h4>Results</h4>Between 2007 and 2009, the proportion of all births attended by CNMs increased by 4% from 7.3% of all births to 7.6% and a total of 313,516. This represents a decline in total births attended by CNMs from 2008 but a higher proportion of all births because total US births dropped at a faster rate. The proportion of vaginal births attended by CNMs reached an all-time high of 11.4% in 2009. There were strong regional patterns to the distribution of CNM-attended births. Births attended by """"other midwives"""" rose to 21,787 or 0.5% of all US births, and the total proportion of all births attended by midwives reached an all-time high of 8.1%. The race/ethnicity of mothers attended by CNMs has shifted over the years. In 1990, CNMs attended a disproportionately high number of births to non-white mothers, whereas in 2009, the profile of CNM births mirrors the national distribution in race/ethnicity.<h4>Discussion</h4>Midwife-attended births in the United States are increasing. The geographic patterns in the distribution of midwife-attended births warrant further study.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
22672254,The gastrointestinal electrical mapping suite (GEMS): software for analyzing and visualizing high-resolution (multi-electrode) recordings in spatiotemporal detail.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gastrointestinal contractions are controlled by an underlying bioelectrical activity. High-resolution spatiotemporal electrical mapping has become an important advance for investigating gastrointestinal electrical behaviors in health and motility disorders. However, research progress has been constrained by the low efficiency of the data analysis tasks. This work introduces a new efficient software package: GEMS (Gastrointestinal Electrical Mapping Suite), for analyzing and visualizing high-resolution multi-electrode gastrointestinal mapping data in spatiotemporal detail.<h4>Results</h4>GEMS incorporates a number of new and previously validated automated analytical and visualization methods into a coherent framework coupled to an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface. GEMS is implemented using MATLAB, which combines sophisticated mathematical operations and GUI compatibility. Recorded slow wave data can be filtered via a range of inbuilt techniques, efficiently analyzed via automated event-detection and cycle clustering algorithms, and high quality isochronal activation maps, velocity field maps, amplitude maps, frequency (time interval) maps and data animations can be rapidly generated. Normal and dysrhythmic activities can be analyzed, including initiation and conduction abnormalities. The software is distributed free to academics via a community user website and forum (http://sites.google.com/site/gimappingsuite).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This software allows for the rapid analysis and generation of critical results from gastrointestinal high-resolution electrical mapping data, including quantitative analysis and graphical outputs for qualitative analysis. The software is designed to be used by non-experts in data and signal processing, and is intended to be used by clinical researchers as well as physiologists and bioengineers.

22689643,MoNetFamily: a web server to infer homologous modules and module-module interaction networks in vertebrates.,"A module is a fundamental unit forming with highly connected proteins and performs a certain kind of biological functions. Modules and module-module interaction (MMI) network are essential for understanding cellular processes and functions. The MoNetFamily web server can identify the modules, homologous modules (called module family) and MMI networks across multiple species for the query protein(s). This server first finds module candidates of the query by using BLASTP to search the module template database (1785 experimental and 1252 structural templates). MoNetFamily then infers the homologous modules of the selected module candidate using protein-protein interaction (PPI) families. According to homologous modules and PPIs, we statistically calculated MMIs and MMI networks across multiple species. For each module candidate, MoNetFamily identifies its neighboring modules and their MMIs in module networks of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Danio rerio. Finally, MoNetFamily shows the conserved proteins, PPI profiles and functional annotations of the module family. Our results indicate that the server can be useful for MMI network (e.g. 1818 modules and 9678 MMIs in H. sapiens) visualizations and query annotations using module families and neighboring modules. We believe that the server is able to provide valuable insights to determine homologous modules and MMI networks across multiple species for studying module evolution and cellular processes.

We introduce TWARIT, a hybrid binning algorithm, that employs a combination of short-read alignment and composition-based signature sorting approaches to achieve rapid binning rates without compromising on binning accuracy and specificity. TWARIT is validated with simulated and real-world metagenomes and the results demonstrate significantly lower overall binning times compared to that of existing methods. Furthermore, the binning accuracy and specificity of TWARIT are observed to be comparable/superior to them.

In this work, we propose a new framework for the detection of fusion transcripts through short paired-end reads which integrates splicing-driven alignment and abundance estimation analysis, producing a more accurate set of reads supporting the junction discovery and taking into account also not annotated transcripts. Bellerophontes performs a selection of putative junctions on the basis of a match to an accurate gene fusion model.<h4>Results</h4>We report the fusion genes discovered by the proposed framework on experimentally validated biological samples of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and on public NCBI datasets, for which Bellerophontes is able to detect the exact junction sequence. With respect to state-of-art approaches, Bellerophontes detects the same experimentally validated fusions, however, it is more selective on the total number of detected fusions and provides a more accurate set of spanning reads supporting the junctions.

Structural genomic projects are beginning to produce protein structures with unknown functions. Therefore, efficient methods are required if all these structures are to be properly annotated. Lots of methods for finding binding sites involve 3D structure comparison. Here we design a method to find protein binding sites by direct comparison of protein 3D structures.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed an efficient heuristic approach for finding similar binding sites from the surface of given proteins. Our approach consists of three steps: local sequence alignment, protein surface detection, and 3D structures comparison. We implement the algorithm and produce a software package that works well in practice. When comparing a complete protein with all complete protein structures in the PDB database, experiments show that the average recall value of our approach is 82% and the average precision value of our approach is also significantly better than the existing approaches.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our program has much higher recall values than those existing programs. Experiments show that all the existing approaches have recall values less than 50%. This implies that more than 50% of real binding sites cannot be reported by those existing approaches.

Numerous computational methods have been published over the past decade, with varying degrees of success. Despite the large number of published methods in this area, only a small fraction of them are available for researchers to use in their own studies. Of those that are available, many are limited by predicting only a small number of organelles in the cell. Additionally, the majority of methods predict only a single location for a sequence, even though it is known that a large fraction of the proteins in eukaryotic species shuttle between locations to carry out their function.<h4>Findings</h4>We present a software package and a web server for predicting the subcellular localization of protein sequences based on the ngLOC method. ngLOC is an n-gram-based Bayesian classifier that predicts subcellular localization of proteins both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The overall prediction accuracy varies from 89.8% to 91.4% across species. This program can predict 11 distinct locations each in plant and animal species. ngLOC also predicts 4 and 5 distinct locations on gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial datasets, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ngLOC is a generic method that can be trained by data from a variety of species or classes for predicting protein subcellular localization.

22796958,A regression model for estimating DNA copy number applied to capture sequencing data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Target enrichment, also referred to as DNA capture, provides an effective way to focus sequencing efforts on a genomic region of interest. Capture data are typically used to detect single-nucleotide variants. It can also be used to detect copy number alterations, which is particularly useful in the context of cancer, where such changes occur frequently. In copy number analysis, it is a common practice to determine log-ratios between test and control samples, but this approach results in a loss of information as it disregards the total coverage or intensity at a locus.<h4>Results</h4>We modeled the coverage or intensity of the test sample as a linear function of the control sample. This regression approach is able to deal with regions that are completely deleted, which are problematic for methods that use log-ratios. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we used capture data to determine copy number for a set of 600 genes in a panel of nine breast cancer cell lines. We found high concordance between our results and those generated using a single-nucleotide polymorphsim genotyping platform. When we compared our results with other log-ratio-based methods, including ExomeCNV, we found that our approach produced better overall correlation with SNP data.<h4>Availability</h4>The algorithm is implemented in C and R and the code can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.nki.nl/ocs/<h4>Contact</h4>l.wessels@nki.nl<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

However, the accuracy of current contact predictors often barely exceeds 20% on long-range contacts, falling short of the level required for ab initio structure prediction.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we develop a novel machine learning approach for contact map prediction using three steps of increasing resolution. First, we use 2D recursive neural networks to predict coarse contacts and orientations between secondary structure elements. Second, we use an energy-based method to align secondary structure elements and predict contact probabilities between residues in contacting alpha-helices or strands. Third, we use a deep neural network architecture to organize and progressively refine the prediction of contacts, integrating information over both space and time. We train the architecture on a large set of non-redundant proteins and test it on a large set of non-homologous domains, as well as on the set of protein domains used for contact prediction in the two most recent CASP8 and CASP9 experiments. For long-range contacts, the accuracy of the new CMAPpro predictor is close to 30%, a significant increase over existing approaches.<h4>Availability</h4>CMAPpro is available as part of the SCRATCH suite at http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/.<h4>Contact</h4>pfbaldi@uci.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
22848493,"qPMS7: a fast algorithm for finding (ℓ, d)-motifs in DNA and protein sequences.","Detection of rare events happening in a set of DNA/protein sequences could lead to new biological discoveries. One kind of such rare events is the presence of patterns called motifs in DNA/protein sequences. Finding motifs is a challenging problem since the general version of motif search has been proven to be intractable. Motifs discovery is an important problem in biology. For example, it is useful in the detection of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional regulatory elements that are very crucial in understanding gene function, human disease, drug design, etc. Many versions of the motif search problem have been proposed in the literature. One such is the (l, d)-motif search (or Planted Motif Search (PMS)). A generalized version of the PMS problem, namely, Quorum Planted Motif Search (qPMS), is shown to accurately model motifs in real data. However, solving the qPMS problem is an extremely difficult task because a special case of it, the PMS Problem, is already NP-hard, which means that any algorithm solving it can be expected to take exponential time in the worse case scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named qPMS7 that tackles the qPMS problem on real data as well as challenging instances. Experimental results show that our Algorithm qPMS7 is on an average 5 times faster than the state-of-art algorithm.

We developed a statistical model to assess the association of drug target pairs based on their relation with other linked objects. Validation experiments demonstrate the model can correctly identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision. Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene expression level) are also identified but not as strongly as direct pairs. We further calculated the association scores for 157 drugs from 10 disease areas against 1683 human targets, and measured their similarity using a [Formula: see text] score matrix. The similarity network indicates that drugs from the same disease area tend to cluster together in ways that are not captured by structural similarity, with several potential new drug pairings being identified. This work thus provides a novel, validated alternative to existing drug target prediction algorithms.

22861649,A re-evaluation of 9-HODE activity at TRPV1 channels in comparison with anandamide: enantioselectivity and effects at other TRP channels and in sensory neurons.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Two oxidation products of linoleic acid, 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs), have recently been suggested to act as endovanilloids, that is, endogenous agonists of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels, thereby contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia in rats. However, HODE activity at rat TRPV1 in comparison with the best established endovanilloid, anandamide, and its enantioselectivity and selectivity towards other TRP channels that are also abundant in sensory neurons have never been investigated.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>We studied the effect of 9(R)-HODE, 9(S)-HODE, (+/-)13-HODE, 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide and anandamide on [Ca(2+) ](i)  in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the rat or human recombinant TRPV1, or rat recombinant TRPV2, TRPA1 or TRPM8, and also the effect of 9(S)-HODE in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons by calcium imaging.<h4>Key results</h4>Anandamide and 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide were the most potent endovanilloids at human TRPV1, whereas 9(S)-HODE was approximately threefold less efficacious and 75- and 3-fold less potent, respectively, and did not perform much better at rat TRPV1. The 9(R)-HODE and (+/-)13-HODE were almost inactive at TRPV1. Unlike anandamide and 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide, all HODEs were very weak at desensitizing TRPV1 to the action of capsaicin, but activated rat TRPV2 [only (+/-)13-HODE] and rat TRPA1, and antagonized rat TRPM8, at concentrations higher than those required to activate TRPV1. Finally, 9(S)-HODE elevated [Ca(2+) ](i)  in DRG neurons almost exclusively in capsaicin-sensitive cells but only at concentrations between 25 and 100 M.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>The present data suggest that HODEs are less important endovanilloids than anandamide.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Cannabinoids.

22915736,Plant B vitamin pathways and their compartmentation: a guide for the perplexed.,"The B vitamins and the cofactors derived from them are essential for life. B vitamin synthesis in plants is consequently as crucial to plants themselves as it is to humans and animals, whose B vitamin nutrition depends largely on plants. The synthesis and salvage pathways for the seven plant B vitamins are now broadly known, but certain enzymes and many transporters have yet to be identified, and the subcellular locations of various reactions are unclear. Although very substantial, what is not known about plant B vitamin pathways is regrettably difficult to discern from the literature or from biochemical pathway databases. Nor do databases accurately represent all that is known about B vitamin pathways-above all their compartmentation-because the facts are scattered throughout the literature, and thus hard to piece together. These problems (i) deter discoveries because newcomers to B vitamins cannot see which mysteries still need solving; and (ii) impede metabolic reconstruction and modelling of B vitamin pathways because genes for reactions or transport steps are missing. This review therefore takes a fresh approach to capture current knowledge of B vitamin pathways in plants. The synthesis pathways, key salvage routes, and their subcellular compartmentation are surveyed in depth, and encoded in the SEED database (http://pubseed.theseed.org/seedviewer.cgi?page=PlantGateway) for Arabidopsis and maize. The review itself and the encoded pathways specifically identify enigmatic or missing reactions, enzymes, and transporters. The SEED-encoded B vitamin pathway collection is a publicly available, expertly curated, one-stop resource for metabolic reconstruction and modeling.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
22954625,Performance reproducibility index for classification.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>A common practice in biomarker discovery is to decide whether a large laboratory experiment should be carried out based on the results of a preliminary study on a small set of specimens. Consideration of the efficacy of this approach motivates the introduction of a probabilistic measure, for whether a classifier showing promising results in a small-sample preliminary study will perform similarly on a large independent sample. Given the error estimate from the preliminary study, if the probability of reproducible error is low, then there is really no purpose in substantially allocating more resources to a large follow-on study. Indeed, if the probability of the preliminary study providing likely reproducible results is small, then why even perform the preliminary study?<h4>Results</h4>This article introduces a reproducibility index for classification, measuring the probability that a sufficiently small error estimate on a small sample will motivate a large follow-on study. We provide a simulation study based on synthetic distribution models that possess known intrinsic classification difficulties and emulate real-world scenarios. We also set up similar simulations on four real datasets to show the consistency of results. The reproducibility indices for different distributional models, real datasets and classification schemes are empirically calculated. The effects of reporting and multiple-rule biases on the reproducibility index are also analyzed.<h4>Availability</h4>We have implemented in C code the synthetic data distribution model, classification rules, feature selection routine and error estimation methods.

The exact characterization of such aberrations remains a challenge despite the availability of increasing amount of data, from SNParray to next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, genomic aberrations in cancer are especially difficult to handle because they are, by nature, unique to the patients. However, their recurrence in specific regions of the genome has been shown to reflect their relevance in the development of tumors. GREVE makes use of previously characterized events to identify such regions and focus any further analysis.<h4>Availability</h4>GREVE is available through a web interface and open-source application (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/GREVE).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
22998891,Patterns of medication initiation in newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus: quality and cost implications.,"Currently, 25 million Americans are known to have diabetes, with an additional 7 million cases believed to be undiagnosed. It is estimated that direct and indirect costs of diabetes top $200 billion. Due to the significant health and financial burdens associated with diabetes, it is imperative that this disease be treated quickly and aggressively. In 2009, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes developed a consensus statement regarding the treatment of type 2 diabetes, citing lifestyle modification and metformin as the preferred first line therapies. In this study, the authors looked at prescription claims data for adults who were newly initiated on oral hypoglycemic monotherapy between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008, to determine if initiation patterns changed over time, to evaluate how well the treatment guidelines were being followed, and to assess the economic consequences of prescribing patterns by drug class for both patients and insurers. The results showed that over the course of the study period the proportion of patients initially treated with metformin increased, whereas those receiving sulfonylureas as first-line therapy decreased. Thiazolidinediones experienced the greatest decrease, falling from 20% to 8%, while prescriptions for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors increase from 0-7%. Over a 6-month period, patients taking metformin or sulfonylureas paid approximately $38 to $40 in co-pays while insurance paid about $77. Patients taking other agents paid approximately $130 in co-pays and insurance paid over $500. The authors concluded that based its cost and safety profile, metformin should be the first line drug therapy for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

23003214,Bulk superconductivity in bismuth oxysulfide Bi4O4S3.,"A very recent report on the observation of superconductivity in Bi(4)O(4)S(3) [Mizuguchi, Y.; http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3145] could potentially reignite the search for superconductivity in a broad range of layered sulfides. We report here the synthesis of Bi(4)O(4)S(3) at 500 C by a vacuum encapsulation technique and its basic characterizations. The as-synthesized Bi(4)O(4)S(3) was contaminated with small amounts of Bi(2)S(3) and Bi impurities. The majority phase was found to be tetragonal (space group I4/mmm) with lattice parameters a = 3.9697(2)  and c = 41.3520(1) . Both AC and DC magnetization measurements confirmed that Bi(4)O(4)S(3) is a bulk superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature (T(c)) of 4.4 K. Isothermal magnetization (M-H) measurements indicated closed loops with clear signatures of flux pinning and irreversible behavior. The lower critical field (H(c1)) at 2 K for the new superconductor was found to be ~15 Oe. Magnetotransport measurements showed a broadening of the resistivity (<U+03C1>) and a decrease in T(c) (<U+03C1> = 0) with increasing magnetic field. The extrapolated upper critical field H(c2)(0) was ~31 kOe with a corresponding Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of ~100  . In the normal state, the <U+03C1> ~ T(2) dependence was not indicated. Hall resistivity data showed a nonlinear magnetic field dependence. Our magnetization and electrical transport measurements substantiate the appearance of bulk superconductivity in as-synthesized Bi(4)O(4)S(3). On the other hand, Bi heat-treated at the same temperature is not superconducting, thus excluding the possibility of impurity-driven superconductivity in the newly discovered superconductor Bi(4)O(4)S(3).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The former option is a basic one and applicable only to full-length sequences, whereas the latter option is applicable even when the unaligned sequences are short and fragmentary. These methods internally infer the phylogenetic relationship among the sequences in the existing alignment and the phylogenetic positions of unaligned sequences. Benchmarks based on two independent simulations consistently suggest that the """"--addfragments"""" option outperforms recent methods, PaPaRa and PAGAN, in accuracy for difficult problems and that these three methods appropriately handle easy problems.<h4>Availability</h4>http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/<h4>Contact</h4>katoh@ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jp<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

23028969,Transcriptome tomography for brain analysis in the web-accessible anatomical space.,"Increased information on the encoded mammalian genome is expected to facilitate an integrated understanding of complex anatomical structure and function based on the knowledge of gene products. Determination of gene expression-anatomy associations is crucial for this understanding. To elicit the association in the three-dimensional (3D) space, we introduce a novel technique for comprehensive mapping of endogenous gene expression into a web-accessible standard space: Transcriptome Tomography. The technique is based on conjugation of sequential tissue-block sectioning, all fractions of which are used for molecular measurements of gene expression densities, and the block- face imaging, which are used for 3D reconstruction of the fractions. To generate a 3D map, tissues are serially sectioned in each of three orthogonal planes and the expression density data are mapped using a tomographic technique. This rapid and unbiased mapping technique using a relatively small number of original data points allows researchers to create their own expression maps in the broad anatomical context of the space. In the first instance we generated a dataset of 36,000 maps, reconstructed from data of 61 fractions measured with microarray, covering the whole mouse brain (ViBrism: http://vibrism.riken.jp/3dviewer/ex/index.html) in one month. After computational estimation of the mapping accuracy we validated the dataset against existing data with respect to the expression location and density. To demonstrate the relevance of the framework, we showed disease related expression of Huntington's disease gene and Bdnf. Our tomographic approach is applicable to analysis of any biological molecules derived from frozen tissues, organs and whole embryos, and the maps are spatially isotropic and well suited to the analysis in the standard space (e.g. Waxholm Space for brain-atlas databases). This will facilitate research creating and using open-standards for a molecular-based understanding of complex structures; and will contribute to new insights into a broad range of biological and medical questions.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

As the population ages and healthcare demands increase, providers are consulting palliative care (PC). Nurse practitioners (NPs) should understand when to consult PC.<h4>Data sources</h4>Information was obtained from an extensive search of the scientific literature to include Pallimed (http://www.pallimed.org/) and the author's clinical experience.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on the 2009 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality PC developed from the Hospice and PC Coalition, PC should be consulted at diagnosis. These findings have also been validated in a landmark randomized controlled trial by Temel et al. (2010). The goals of PC are to alleviate suffering and promote quality of life for people with illnesses. PC accepts and incorporates hospice philosophies, but is distinct.<h4>Implications for practice</h4>Many professional organizations are incorporating PC into their specialties and guidelines. In addition to incorporating PC at diagnosis, PC access needs to be improved. New and experienced NPs may appreciate collaborating with PC specialists. Such conversations and relationships will likely offer practical and supportive guidance to both patients and NPs. Overall, the future for PC is promising.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,clinical
23118487,CellLineNavigator: a workbench for cancer cell line analysis.,"The CellLineNavigator database, freely available at http://www.medicalgenomics.org/celllinenavigator, is a web-based workbench for large scale comparisons of a large collection of diverse cell lines.

To enlarge the scope of CellLineNavigator, the database was furthermore closely linked to commonly used bioinformatics databases and knowledge repositories. To ensure easy data access and search ability, a simple data and an intuitive querying interface were implemented. It allows the user to explore and filter gene expression, focusing on pathological or physiological conditions. For a more complex search, the advanced query interface may be used to query for (i) differentially expressed genes; (ii) pathological or physiological conditions; or (iii) gene names or functional attributes, such as Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway maps. These queries may also be combined. Finally, CellLineNavigator allows additional advanced analysis of differentially regulated genes by a direct link to the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Resources.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

This study attempts to find a possible lead compound backbone from TCM Database@Taiwan ( http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw/ ) for EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins against head and neck cancer using computational techniques. Possible traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) lead compounds had potential binding affinities with EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins. The candidates formed stable interactions with residues Arg803, Thr854 in EGFR, residues Thr862, Asp863 in Her2 protein, and residues Arg37, Arg41 in UROD protein, which are key residues in the binding or catalytic domain of EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins.

Its underlying index structure is designed to quickly retrieve all occurrences of a tryptic peptide in UniProtKB records. Taxon-specificity of the tryptic peptide is successively derived from these occurrences using a novel lowest common ancestor approach that is robust against taxonomic misarrangements, misidentifications, and inaccuracies. Not taking into account this identification noise would otherwise result in drastic loss of information. Dynamic treemaps visualize the biodiversity of metaproteome samples, which eases the exploration of samples with highly complex compositions.

23153250,"MTMDAT-HADDOCK: high-throughput, protein complex structure modeling based on limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry.","<h4>Background</h4>MTMDAT is a program designed to facilitate analysis of mass spectrometry data of proteins and biomolecular complexes that are probed structurally by limited proteolysis. This approach can provide information about stable fragments of multidomain proteins, yield tertiary and quaternary structure data, and help determine the origin of stability changes at the amino acid residue level. Here, we introduce a pipeline between MTMDAT and HADDOCK, that facilitates protein-protein complex structure probing in a high-throughput and highly automated fashion.<h4>Results</h4>A new feature of MTMDAT allows for the direct identification of residues that are involved in complex formation by comparing the mass spectra of bound and unbound proteins after proteolysis. If 3D structures of the unbound components are available, this data can be used to define restraints for data-driven docking to calculate a model of the complex. We describe here a new implementation of MTMDAT, which includes a pipeline to the data-driven docking program HADDOCK, thus streamlining the entire procedure. This addition, together with usability improvements in MTMDAT, enables high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data. The algorithm has been validated by using the protein-protein interaction between the ubiquitin-binding domain of proteasome component Rpn13 and ubiquitin. The resulting structural model, based on restraints extracted by MTMDAT from limited proteolysis and modeled by HADDOCK, was compared to the published NMR structure, which relied on twelve unambiguous intermolecular NOE interactions. The MTMDAT-HADDOCK structure was of similar quality to structures generated using only chemical shift perturbation data derived by NMR titration experiments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new MTMDAT-HADDOCK pipeline enables direct high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data. MTMDAT-HADDOCK can be downloaded from http://www.ifm.liu.se/chemistry/molbiotech/maria_sunnerhagens_group/mtmdat/together with the manual and example files.

23181585,A Monte Carlo-based framework enhances the discovery and interpretation of regulatory sequence motifs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Discovery of functionally significant short, statistically overrepresented subsequence patterns (motifs) in a set of sequences is a challenging problem in bioinformatics. Oftentimes, not all sequences in the set contain a motif. These non-motif-containing sequences complicate the algorithmic discovery of motifs. Filtering the non-motif-containing sequences from the larger set of sequences while simultaneously determining the identity of the motif is, therefore, desirable and a non-trivial problem in motif discovery research.<h4>Results</h4>We describe MotifCatcher, a framework that extends the sensitivity of existing motif-finding tools by employing random sampling to effectively remove non-motif-containing sequences from the motif search. We developed two implementations of our algorithm; each built around a commonly used motif-finding tool, and applied our algorithm to three diverse chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data sets. In each case, the motif finder with the MotifCatcher extension demonstrated improved sensitivity over the motif finder alone. Our approach organizes candidate functionally significant discovered motifs into a tree, which allowed us to make additional insights. In all cases, we were able to support our findings with experimental work from the literature.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our framework demonstrates that additional processing at the sequence entry level can significantly improve the performance of existing motif-finding tools. For each biological data set tested, we were able to propose novel biological hypotheses supported by experimental work from the literature. Specifically, in Escherichia coli, we suggested binding site motifs for 6 non-traditional LexA protein binding sites; in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we hypothesize 2 disparate mechanisms for novel binding sites of the Cse4p protein; and in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we discoverd subtle differences in a general transcription factor (GTF) binding site motif across several data sets. We suggest that small differences in our discovered motif could confer specificity for one or more homologous GTF proteins.

23192052,Hierarchical shrinkage priors and model fitting for high-dimensional generalized linear models.,"Abstract     Genetic and other scientific studies routinely generate very many predictor variables, which can be naturally grouped, with predictors in the same groups being highly correlated. It is desirable to incorporate the hierarchical structure of the predictor variables into generalized linear models for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation. We propose two prior distributions: hierarchical Cauchy and double-exponential distributions, on coefficients in generalized linear models. The hierarchical priors include both variable-specific and group-specific tuning parameters, thereby not only adopting different shrinkage for different coefficients and different groups but also providing a way to pool the information within groups. We fit generalized linear models with the proposed hierarchical priors by incorporating flexible expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms into the standard iteratively weighted least squares as implemented in the general statistical package R. The methods are illustrated with data from an experiment to identify genetic polymorphisms for survival of mice following infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The performance of the proposed procedures is further assessed via simulation studies. The methods are implemented in a freely available R package BhGLM (http://www.ssg.uab.edu/bhglm/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23217202,Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) for generating atomic style objects for molecular modeling.,"<h4>Background</h4>With the progress of nanotechnology, one frequently has to model biological macromolecules simultaneously with nano-objects. However, the atomic structures of the nano objects are typically not available or they are solid state entities. Because of that, the researchers have to investigate such nano systems by generating models of the nano objects in a manner that the existing software be able to carry the simulations. In addition, it should allow generating composite objects with complex shape by combining basic geometrical figures and embedding biological macromolecules within the system.<h4>Results</h4>Here we report the Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) which allows for generating atomic-style geometrical objects with user desired shape and dimensions. Unlimited number of objects can be created and combined with biological macromolecules in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format file. Once the objects are generated, the users can use sliders to manipulate their shape, dimension and absolute position. In addition, the software offers the option to charge the objects with either specified surface or volumetric charge density and to model them with user-desired dielectric constants. According to the user preference, the biological macromolecule atoms can be assigned charges and radii according to four different force fields: Amber, Charmm, OPLS and PARSE. The biological macromolecules and the atomic-style objects are exported as a position, charge and radius (PQR) file, or if a default dielectric constant distribution is not selected, it is exported as a position, charge, radius and epsilon (PQRE) file. As illustration of the capabilities of the ProNOI, we created a composite object in a shape of a robot, aptly named the Clemson Robot, whose parts are charged with various volumetric charge densities and holds the barnase-barstar protein complex in its hand.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) is a convenient tool for generating atomic-style nano shapes in conjunction with biological macromolecule(s). Charges and radii on the macromolecule atoms and the atoms in the shapes are assigned according to the user's preferences allowing various scenarios of modeling.

23271269,Inference of gene regulatory networks from genome-wide knockout fitness data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genome-wide fitness is an emerging type of high-throughput biological data generated for individual organisms by creating libraries of knockouts, subjecting them to broad ranges of environmental conditions, and measuring the resulting clone-specific fitnesses. Since fitness is an organism-scale measure of gene regulatory network behaviour, it may offer certain advantages when insights into such phenotypical and functional features are of primary interest over individual gene expression. Previous works have shown that genome-wide fitness data can be used to uncover novel gene regulatory interactions, when compared with results of more conventional gene expression analysis. Yet, to date, few algorithms have been proposed for systematically using genome-wide mutant fitness data for gene regulatory network inference.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we describe a model and propose an inference algorithm for using fitness data from knockout libraries to identify underlying gene regulatory networks. Unlike most prior methods, the presented approach captures not only structural, but also dynamical and non-linear nature of biomolecular systems involved. A state-space model with non-linear basis is used for dynamically describing gene regulatory networks. Network structure is then elucidated by estimating unknown model parameters. Unscented Kalman filter is used to cope with the non-linearities introduced in the model, which also enables the algorithm to run in on-line mode for practical use. Here, we demonstrate that the algorithm provides satisfying results for both synthetic data as well as empirical measurements of GAL network in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and TyrR-LiuR network in bacteria Shewanella oneidensis.<h4>Availability</h4>MATLAB code and datasets are available to download at http://www.duke.edu/~lw174/Fitness.zip and http://genomics.lbl.gov/supplemental/fitness-bioinf/","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,zip file
23281802,BM-Map: an efficient software package for accurately allocating multireads of RNA-sequencing data.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a major tool for biomedical research. A key step in analyzing RNA-seq data is to infer the origin of short reads in the source genome, and for this purpose, many read alignment/mapping software programs have been developed. Usually, the majority of mappable reads can be mapped to one unambiguous genomic location, and these reads are called unique reads. However, a considerable proportion of mappable reads can be aligned to more than one genomic location with the same or similar fidelities, and they are called """"multireads"""". Allocating these multireads is challenging but critical for interpreting RNA-seq data. We recently developed a Bayesian stochastic model that allocates multireads more accurately than alternative methods (Ji et al. Biometrics 2011).<h4>Results</h4>In order to serve a greater biological community, we have implemented this method in a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package, BM-Map. BM-Map takes SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), the most popular read alignment format, as the standard input; then based on the Bayesian model, it calculates mapping probabilities of multireads for competing genomic loci; and BM-Map generates the output by adding mapping probabilities to the original SAM file so that users can easily perform downstream analyses. The program is available in three common operating systems, Linux, Mac and PC. Moreover, we have built a dedicated website, http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/BM-Map, which includes free downloads, detailed tutorials and illustration examples.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have developed a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package for accurately allocating multireads, which is an important addition to our previous methodology paper. We believe that this bioinformatics tool will greatly help RNA-seq and related applications reach their full potential in life science research.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23303509,ALE: a generic assembly likelihood evaluation framework for assessing the accuracy of genome and metagenome assemblies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Researchers need general purpose methods for objectively evaluating the accuracy of single and metagenome assemblies and for automatically detecting any errors they may contain. Current methods do not fully meet this need because they require a reference, only consider one of the many aspects of assembly quality or lack statistical justification, and none are designed to evaluate metagenome assemblies.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we present an Assembly Likelihood Evaluation (ALE) framework that overcomes these limitations, systematically evaluating the accuracy of an assembly in a reference-independent manner using rigorous statistical methods. This framework is comprehensive, and integrates read quality, mate pair orientation and insert length (for paired-end reads), sequencing coverage, read alignment and k-mer frequency. ALE pinpoints synthetic errors in both single and metagenomic assemblies, including single-base errors, insertions/deletions, genome rearrangements and chimeric assemblies presented in metagenomes. At the genome level with real-world data, ALE identifies three large misassemblies from the Spirochaeta smaragdinae finished genome, which were all independently validated by Pacific Biosciences sequencing. At the single-base level with Illumina data, ALE recovers 215 of 222 (97%) single nucleotide variants in a training set from a GC-rich Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome. Using real Pacific Biosciences data, ALE identifies 12 of 12 synthetic errors in a Lambda Phage genome, surpassing even Pacific Biosciences' own variant caller, EviCons. In summary, the ALE framework provides a comprehensive, reference-independent and statistically rigorous measure of single genome and metagenome assembly accuracy, which can be used to identify misassemblies or to optimize the assembly process.<h4>Availability</h4>ALE is released as open source software under the UoI/NCSA license at http://www.alescore.org.

23337681,Medical mentoring via the evolving world wide web.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Mentoring, for physicians and surgeons in training, is advocated as an essential adjunct in work-based learning, providing support in career and non-career related issues. The World Wide Web (WWW) has evolved, as a technology, to become more interactive and person centric, tailoring itself to the individual needs of the user. This changing technology may open new avenues to foster mentoring in medicine. DESIGN, SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A search of the MEDLINE database from 1950 to 2012 using the PubMed interface, combined with manual cross-referencing was performed using the following strategy: (""""mentors""""[MeSH Terms] OR """"mentors""""[All Fields] OR """"mentor""""[All Fields]) AND (""""internet""""[MeSH Terms] OR """"internet""""[All Fields]) AND (""""medicine""""[MeSH Terms] OR """"medicine""""[All Fields]) AND (""""humans""""[MeSH Terms] AND English[lang]). Abstracts were screened for relevance (UJ) to the topic; eligibility for inclusion was simply on screening for relevance to online mentoring and web-based technologies.<h4>Results</h4>Forty-five papers were found, of which 16 were relevant. All studies were observational in nature. To date, all medical mentoring applications utilizing the World Wide Web have enjoyed some success limited by Web 1.0 and 2.0 technologies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>With the evolution of the WWW through 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 generations, the potential for meaningful tele- and distance mentoring has greatly improved. Some engagement has been made with these technological advancements, however further work is required to fully realize the potential of these technologies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23342084,Early growth response 3 (Egr3) is highly over-expressed in non-relapsing prostate cancer but not in relapsing prostate cancer.,"Members of the early growth response (EGR) family of transcription factors play diverse functions in response to many cellular stimuli, including growth, stress, and inflammation. Egr3 has gone relatively unstudied, but here through use of the SPECS (Strategic Partners for the Evaluation of Predictive Signatures of Prostate Cancer) Affymetrix whole genome gene expression database we report that Egr3 mRNA is significantly over-expressed in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissue (5-fold). The Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org), a database of tissue microarrays labeled with antibodies against over 11,000 human proteins, was utilized to quantify Egr3 protein expression in normal prostate and prostate cancer patients. In agreement with the SPECS data, we found that Egr3 protein is significantly increased in prostate cancer. The SPECS database has the benefit of extensive clinical follow up for the prostate cancer patients. Analysis of Egr3 mRNA expression in relation to the relapse status reveals that Egr3 mRNA expression is increased in tumor cells of non-relapsed samples (n = 63) compared to normal prostate cells, but is significantly lower in relapsed samples (n = 38) compared to non-relapse. The observations were confirmed using an independent data set. A list of genes correlating with this unique expression pattern was determined. These Egr3-correlated genes were enriched with Egr binding sites in their promoters. The gene list contains inflammatory genes such as IL-6, IL-8, IL1 and COX-2, which have extensive connections to prostate cancer.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Our study applied high-throughput screening methods to identify causative epigenetic targets in a cohort of men with ABC-associated OSCC. We identified BEX1 and LDOC1 as two epigenetically silenced X-linked tumour suppressors and demonstrated a functional link between the transcription of BEX1 and LDOC1 and promoter hypermethylation. Methylation of the BEX1 and LDOC1 promoters was associated significantly (p < 0.0001) with OSCC and were detected in 75% (42/56) and 89% (50/56) of the samples, respectively. We observed concordant increases in the methylation of both genes in 71% (40/56) of the tumours, and potent in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory effects in OSCC cells ectopically expressing BEX1 and/or LDOC1. Restored expression of BEX1 and LDOC1 suppressed the nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) signalling pathway, which is the most frequently hyperactivated signalling pathway in OSCC. This suppression might result from decreased p50 and p65 expression. These findings suggest that silencing of BEX1 and LDOC1 by promoter hypermethylation might represent a critical event in the molecular pathogenesis of OSCC and account for the oncogenic effects of ABC exposure and the male predominance of OSCC occurrence.

23368677,Identifying cross-category relations in gene ontology and constructing genome-specific term association networks.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gene Ontology (GO) has been widely used in biological databases, annotation projects, and computational analyses. Although the three GO categories are structured as independent ontologies, the biological relationships across the categories are not negligible for biological reasoning and knowledge integration. However, the existing cross-category ontology term similarity measures are either developed by utilizing the GO data only or based on manually curated term name similarities, ignoring the fact that GO is evolving quickly and the gene annotations are far from complete.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper we introduce a new cross-category similarity measurement called CroGO by incorporating genome-specific gene co-function network data. The performance study showed that our measurement outperforms the existing algorithms. We also generated genome-specific term association networks for yeast and human. An enrichment based test showed our networks are better than those generated by the other measures.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The genome-specific term association networks constructed using CroGO provided a platform to enable a more consistent use of GO. In the networks, the frequently occurred MF-centered hub indicates that a molecular function may be shared by different genes in multiple biological processes, or a set of genes with the same functions may participate in distinct biological processes. And common subgraphs in multiple organisms also revealed conserved GO term relationships. Software and data are available online at http://www.msu.edu/~jinchen/CroGO.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,iffy
23375235,Learning the local Bayesian network structure around the ZNF217 oncogene in breast tumours.,"In this study, we discuss and apply a novel and efficient algorithm for learning a local Bayesian network model in the vicinity of the ZNF217 oncogene from breast cancer microarray data without having to decide in advance which genes have to be included in the learning process. ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene located at 20q13, a chromosomal region frequently amplified in breast and ovarian cancer, and correlated with shorter patient survival in these cancers. To properly address the difficulties in managing complex gene interactions given our limited sample, statistical significance of edge strengths was evaluated using bootstrapping and the less reliable edges were pruned to increase the network robustness. We found that 13 out of the 35 genes associated with deregulated ZNF217 expression in breast tumours have been previously associated with survival and/or prognosis in cancers. Identifying genes involved in lipid metabolism opens new fields of investigation to decipher the molecular mechanisms driven by the ZNF217 oncogene. Moreover, nine of the 13 genes have already been identified as putative ZNF217 targets by independent biological studies. We therefore suggest that the algorithms for inferring local BNs are valuable data mining tools for unraveling complex mechanisms of biological pathways from expression data.

23377977,Discovery of microRNA regulatory networks by integrating multidimensional high-throughput data.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) of approximately 22 nt that regulate the expression of a large fraction of genes by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs). However, determining the biologically significant targets of miRNAs is an ongoing challenge. In this chapter, we describe how to identify miRNA-target interactions and miRNA regulatory networks from high-throughput deep sequencing, CLIP-Seq (HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP) and degradome sequencing data using starBase platforms. In starBase, several web-based and stand-alone computational tools were developed to discover Argonaute (Ago) binding and cleavage sites, miRNA-target interactions, perform enrichment analysis of miRNA target genes in Gene Ontology (GO) categories and biological pathways, and identify combinatorial effects between Ago and other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Investigating target pathways of miRNAs in human CLIP-Seq data, we found that many cancer-associated miRNAs modulate cancer pathways. Performing an enrichment analysis of genes targeted by highly expressed miRNAs in the mouse brain showed that many miRNAs are involved in cancer-associated MAPK signaling and glioma pathways, as well as neuron-associated neurotrophin signaling and axon guidance pathways. Moreover, thousands of combinatorial binding sites between Ago and RBPs were identified from CLIP-Seq data suggesting RBPs and miRNAs coordinately regulate mRNA transcripts. As a means of comprehensively integrating CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data, the starBase platform is expected to identify clinically relevant miRNA-target regulatory relationships, and reveal multi-dimensional post-transcriptional regulatory networks involving miRNAs and RBPs. starBase is available at                  http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/                                .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23394478,Multiple consensus trees: a method to separate divergent genes.,"<h4>Background</h4>It is generally admitted that the species tree cannot be inferred from the genetic sequences of a single gene because the evolution of different genes, and thus the gene tree topologies, may vary substantially. Gene trees can differ, for example, because of horizontal transfer events or because some of them correspond to paralogous instead of orthologous sequences. A variety of methods has been proposed to tackle the problem of the reconciliation of gene trees in order to reconstruct a species tree. When the taxa in all the trees are identical, the problem can be stated as a consensus tree problem.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper we define a new method for deciding whether a unique consensus tree or multiple consensus trees can best represent a set of given phylogenetic trees. If the given trees are all congruent, they should be compatible into a single consensus tree. Otherwise, several consensus trees corresponding to divergent genetic patterns can be identified. We introduce a method optimizing the generalized score, over a set of tree partitions in order to decide whether the given set of gene trees is homogeneous or not.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed method has been validated with simulated data (random trees organized in three topological groups) as well as with real data (bootstrap trees, homogeneous set of trees, and a set of non homogeneous gene trees of 30 E. Coli strains; it is worth noting that some of the latter genes underwent horizontal gene transfers). A computer program, MCT - Multiple Consensus Trees, written in C was made freely available for the research community (it can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.lif.univ-mrs.fr/consensus/index.html). It handles trees in a standard Newick format, builds three hierarchies corresponding to RF and QS similarities between trees and the greedy ascending algorithm. The generalized score values of all tree partitions are computed.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

23419168,CD44/CD24 immunophenotypes on clinicopathologic features of salivary glands malignant neoplasms.,"<h4>Background</h4>Salivary glands malignant neoplasms (SGMNs) account for 3-6% of head and neck cancers and 0.3% of all cancers. Tumor cells that express CD44 and CD24 exhibit a stem-cell-like behavior. CD44 is the binding site for hyaluronic acid, and CD24 is a receptor that interacts with P-selectin to induce metastasis and tumor progression. The present study aims to evaluate the expression of CD44 and CD24 on SGMNs and correlated these data with several clinicopathologic features.<h4>Methods</h4>Immunohistochemical stains for CD44 and CD24 were performed on tissue microarrays containing SGMN samples from 69 patients. The CD44, CD24 and CD44/CD24 expression phenotypes were correlated to patient clinicopathologic features and outcome.<h4>Results</h4>CD44 expression was associated with the primary site of neoplasm (p = 0.046). CD24 was associated with clinical stage III/IV (p = 0.008), T stage (p = 0,27) and lymph node (p = 0,001). The CD44/CD24 profiles were associated with the primary site of injury (p = 0.005), lymph node (p = 0.011) and T stage (p = 0.023). Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between clinical staging and disease- free survival (p = 0.009), and the overall survival presents relation with male gender (p = 0.011) and metastasis (p = 0.027).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, our investigation confirms that the clinical stage, in accordance with the literature, is the main prognostic factor for SGMN. Additionally, we have presented some evidence that the analysis of isolated CD44 and CD24 immunoexpression or the two combined markers could give prognostic information associated to clinicopathologic features in SGMN.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1284611098470676.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23493323,BRANCH: boosting RNA-Seq assemblies with partial or related genomic sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>De novo transcriptome assemblies of RNA-Seq data are important for genomics applications of unsequenced organisms. Owing to the complexity and often incomplete representation of transcripts in sequencing libraries, the assembly of high-quality transcriptomes can be challenging. However, with the rapidly growing number of sequenced genomes, it is now feasible to improve RNA-Seq assemblies by guiding them with genomic sequences.<h4>Results</h4>This study introduces BRANCH, an algorithm designed for improving de novo transcriptome assemblies by using genomic information that can be partial or complete genome sequences from the same or a related organism. Its input includes assembled RNA reads (transfrags), genomic sequences (e.g. contigs) and the RNA reads themselves. It uses a customized version of BLAT to align the transfrags and RNA reads to the genomic sequences. After identifying exons from the alignments, it defines a directed acyclic graph and maps the transfrags to paths on the graph. It then joins and extends the transfrags by applying an algorithm that solves a combinatorial optimization problem, called the Minimum weight Minimum Path Cover with given Paths. In performance tests on real data from Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, assisted by genomic contigs from the same species, BRANCH improved the sensitivity and precision of transfrags generated by Velvet/Oases or Trinity by 5.1-56.7% and 0.3-10.5%, respectively. These improvements added 3.8-74.1% complete transcripts and 8.3-3.8% proteins to the initial assembly. Similar improvements were achieved when guiding the BRANCH processing of a transcriptome assembly from a more complex organism (mouse) with genomic sequences from a related species (rat).<h4>Availability</h4>The BRANCH software can be downloaded for free from this site: http://manuals.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/home/branch.<h4>Contact</h4>thomas.girke@ucr.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23504016,Genomic reconstruction of the transcriptional regulatory network in Bacillus subtilis.,"The adaptation of microorganisms to their environment is controlled by complex transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), which are still only partially understood even for model species. Genome scale annotation of regulatory features of genes and TRN reconstruction are challenging tasks of microbial genomics. We used the knowledge-driven comparative-genomics approach implemented in the RegPredict Web server to infer TRN in the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and 10 related Bacillales species. For transcription factor (TF) regulons, we combined the available information from the DBTBS database and the literature with bioinformatics tools, allowing inference of TF binding sites (TFBSs), comparative analysis of the genomic context of predicted TFBSs, functional assignment of target genes, and effector prediction. For RNA regulons, we used known RNA regulatory motifs collected in the Rfam database to scan genomes and analyze the genomic context of new RNA sites. The inferred TRN in B. subtilis comprises regulons for 129 TFs and 24 regulatory RNA families. First, we analyzed 66 TF regulons with previously known TFBSs in B. subtilis and projected them to other Bacillales genomes, resulting in refinement of TFBS motifs and identification of novel regulon members. Second, we inferred motifs and described regulons for 28 experimentally studied TFs with previously unknown TFBSs. Third, we discovered novel motifs and reconstructed regulons for 36 previously uncharacterized TFs. The inferred collection of regulons is available in the RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov/) and can be used in genetic experiments, metabolic modeling, and evolutionary analysis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data deposited as referenced
23504705,Accurate prediction of hot spot residues through physicochemical characteristics of amino acid sequences.,"Hot spot residues of proteins are fundamental interface residues that help proteins perform their functions. Detecting hot spots by experimental methods is costly and time-consuming. Sequential and structural information has been widely used in the computational prediction of hot spots. However, structural information is not always available. In this article, we investigated the problem of identifying hot spots using only physicochemical characteristics extracted from amino acid sequences. We first extracted 132 relatively independent physicochemical features from a set of the 544 properties in AAindex1, an amino acid index database. Each feature was utilized to train a classification model with a novel encoding schema for hot spot prediction by the IBk algorithm, an extension of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. The combinations of the individual classifiers were explored and the classifiers that appeared frequently in the top performing combinations were selected. The hot spot predictor was built based on an ensemble of these classifiers and to work in a voting manner. Experimental results demonstrated that our method effectively exploited the feature space and allowed flexible weights of features for different queries. On the commonly used hot spot benchmark sets, our method significantly outperformed other machine learning algorithms and state-of-the-art hot spot predictors.

However, there is still no consensus for the use of biomarkers in clinical acute spinal cord injury (SCI). The aims of this review are (1) to evaluate the current status of neurochemical biomarkers and (2) to discuss their potential acute diagnostic role in SCI by reviewing the literature.<h4>Methods</h4>PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) was searched up to 2012 to identify publications concerning diagnostic biomarkers in SCI. To support more knowledge, we also checked secondary references in the primarily retrieved literature.<h4>Results</h4>Neurofilaments, cleaved-Tau, microtubule-associated protein 2, myelin basic protein, neuron-specific enolase, S100, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were identified as structural protein biomarkers in SCI by this review process. We could not find reports relating ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 and a-II spectrin breakdown products, which are widely researched in other central nervous system injuries. Therefore, we present our preliminary data relating to these two biomarkers. Some of biomarkers showed promising results for SCI diagnosis and outcome prediction; however, there were unresolved issues relating to accuracy and their accessibility.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Currently, there still are not many reports focused on diagnostic biomarkers in SCI. This fact warranted the need for greater efforts to innovate sensitive and reliable biomarkers for SCI.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not about the resource

The objective of this study was to investigate the balance of Th17/Treg and the expression of related cytokines in Uighur cervical cancer patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Peripheral blood was collected from 65 cases of cervical cancer patients, 42 cases of cervical CIN patients and 40 healthy people. Flow cytometry was used to detect the percentages of T cell subsets, including CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, Treg cells and Th17 cells. ELISA assay was conducted to detect expression levels of TGF-, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23 and IFN-<U+03B3>.<h4>Results</h4>There were no significant difference in the levels of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ among the cervical cancer group, the CIN group and the healthy control group. However, compared with the healthy control group, the percentages of CD4+ CD25+ Treg, CD4+CD25+CD127- Treg, CD4+IL17+ Th17, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+, CD4+CD25- Foxp3+, CD8+CD25+CD127-Treg and CD8+CD25+Foxp3 were significantly higher in the cervical cancer group and the CIN group. Similar results were also found in the Th17/Treg ratio and the related cytokines. There was no significant difference between the cervical cancer group and the CIN group. Additionally, Th17 cell levels were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17. Also, Treg cell levels were positively correlated with TGF-, IL-10 and IL-6. Contrarily, Treg cell levels and IFN-<U+03B3> were negatively correlated.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data indicated that the Th17/Treg balance was broken in peripheral blood of cervical cancer patients. Analysis of Th17/Treg balance may have a significant implication in diagnosing cervical cancer.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1813823795931511.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Beyond the previous efforts for NGS data alignment, variant detection, and visualization, developing a comprehensive annotation system supported by multiple layers of disease phenotype-related databases is essential for deciphering the human genome. To satisfy the impending need to decipher the human genome, it is essential to develop a comprehensive annotation system supported by multiple layers of disease phenotype-related databases.<h4>Methods</h4>AnsNGS (Annotation system of sequence variations for next-generation sequencing data) is a tool for contextualizing variants related to diseases and examining their functional consequences. The AnsNGS integrates a variety of annotation databases to attain multiple levels of annotation.<h4>Results</h4>The AnsNGS assigns biological functions to variants, and provides gene (or disease)-centric queries for finding disease-causing variants. The AnsNGS also connects those genes harbouring variants and the corresponding expression probes for downstream analysis using expression microarrays. Here, we demonstrate its ability to identify disease-related variants in the human genome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The AnsNGS can give a key insight into which of these variants is already known to be involved in a disease-related phenotype or located in or near a known regulatory site.

23664230,Application of the Bayesian approach for derivation of PDFs for concentration ratio values.,"Concentration ratios (CRs) are used to derive activity concentrations in wild plants and animals. Usually, compilations of CR values encompass a wide range of element-organism combinations, extracted from different studies with statistical information reported at varying degrees of detail. To produce a more robust estimation of distribution parameters, data from different studies are normally pooled using classical statistical methods. However, there is inherent subjectivity involved in pooling CR data in the sense that there is a tacit assumption that the CRs under any arbitrarily defined biota category belong to the same population. Here, Bayesian inference has been introduced as an alternative way of making estimates of distribution parameters of CRs. This approach, in contrast to classical methods, is more flexible and also allows us to define the various assumptions required, when combining data, in a more explicit manner. Taking selected data from the recently compiled wildlife transfer database (http://www.wildlifetransferdatabase.org/) as a working example, attempts are made to refine the pooling approaches previously used and to consider situations when empirical data are limited.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,but usedful ref
23685432,DRIMust: a web server for discovering rank imbalanced motifs using suffix trees.,"Cellular regulation mechanisms that involve proteins and other active molecules interacting with specific targets often involve the recognition of sequence patterns. Short sequence elements on DNA, RNA and proteins play a central role in mediating such molecular recognition events. Studies that focus on measuring and investigating sequence-based recognition processes make use of statistical and computational tools that support the identification and understanding of sequence motifs. We present a new web application, named DRIMust, freely accessible through the website http://drimust.technion.ac.il for de novo motif discovery services. The DRIMust algorithm is based on the minimum hypergeometric statistical framework and uses suffix trees for an efficient enumeration of motif candidates. DRIMust takes as input ranked lists of sequences in FASTA format and returns motifs that are over-represented at the top of the list, where the determination of the threshold that defines top is data driven. The resulting motifs are presented individually with an accurate P-value indication and as a Position Specific Scoring Matrix. Comparing DRIMust with other state-of-the-art tools demonstrated significant advantage to DRIMust, both in result accuracy and in short running times. Overall, DRIMust is unique in combining efficient search on large ranked lists with rigorous P-value assessment for the detected motifs.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23685613,Prediction of clustered RNA-binding protein motif sites in the mammalian genome.,"Sequence-specific interactions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target transcripts are essential for post-transcriptional gene expression regulation in mammals. However, accurate prediction of RBP motif sites has been difficult because many RBPs recognize short and degenerate sequences. Here we describe a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based algorithm mCarts to predict clustered functional RBP-binding sites by effectively integrating the number and spacing of individual motif sites, their accessibility in local RNA secondary structures and cross-species conservation. This algorithm learns and quantifies rules of these features, taking advantage of a large number of in vivo RBP-binding sites obtained from cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data. We applied this algorithm to study two representative RBP families, Nova and Mbnl, which regulate tissue-specific alternative splicing through interacting with clustered YCAY and YGCY elements, respectively, and predicted their binding sites in the mouse transcriptome. Despite the low information content in individual motif elements, our algorithm made specific predictions for successful experimental validation. Analysis of predicted sites also revealed cases of extensive and distal RBP-binding sites important for splicing regulation. This algorithm can be readily applied to other RBPs to infer their RNA-regulatory networks.

Recent studies have shown that both physics-based and knowledge-based potential functions can be applied to protein-DNA complex structures to deliver position weight matrices (PWMs) that are consistent with the experimental data. To further use the available structural models, the proposed Web server, PiDNA, aims at first constructing reliable PWMs by applying an atomic-level knowledge-based scoring function on numerous in silico mutated complex structures, and then using the PWM constructed by the structure models with small energy changes to predict the interaction between proteins and DNA sequences. With PiDNA, the users can easily predict the relative preference of all the DNA sequences with limited mutations from the native sequence co-crystallized in the model in a single run. More predictions on sequences with unlimited mutations can be realized by additional requests or file uploading. Three types of information can be downloaded after prediction: (i) the ranked list of mutated sequences, (ii) the PWM constructed by the favourable mutated structures, and (iii) any mutated protein-DNA complex structure models specified by the user. This study first shows that the constructed PWMs are similar to the annotated PWMs collected from databases or literature. Second, the prediction accuracy of PiDNA in detecting relatively high-specificity sites is evaluated by comparing the ranked lists against in vitro experiments from protein-binding microarrays. Finally, PiDNA is shown to be able to select the experimentally validated binding sites from 10,000 random sites with high accuracy. With PiDNA, the users can design biological experiments based on the predicted sequence specificity and/or request mutated structure models for further protein design. As well, it is expected that PiDNA can be incorporated with chromatin immunoprecipitation data to refine large-scale inference of in vivo protein-DNA interactions.

23732274,AuthorReward: increasing community curation in biological knowledge wikis through automated authorship quantification.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Community curation-harnessing community intelligence in knowledge curation, bears great promise in dealing with the flood of biological knowledge. To exploit the full potential of the scientific community for knowledge curation, multiple biological wikis (bio-wikis) have been built to date. However, none of them have achieved a substantial impact on knowledge curation. One of the major limitations in bio-wikis is insufficient community participation, which is intrinsically because of lack of explicit authorship and thus no credit for community curation. To increase community curation in bio-wikis, here we develop AuthorReward, an extension to MediaWiki, to reward community-curated efforts in knowledge curation. AuthorReward quantifies researchers' contributions by properly factoring both edit quantity and quality and yields automated explicit authorship according to their quantitative contributions. AuthorReward provides bio-wikis with an authorship metric, helpful to increase community participation in bio-wikis and to achieve community curation of massive biological knowledge.<h4>Availability</h4>http://cbb.big.ac.cn/software.<h4>Contact</h4>zhangzhang@big.ac.cn<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

23737449,antiSMASH 2.0--a versatile platform for genome mining of secondary metabolite producers.,"Microbial secondary metabolites are a potent source of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. Genome mining of their biosynthetic gene clusters has become a key method to accelerate their identification and characterization. In 2011, we developed antiSMASH, a web-based analysis platform that automates this process. Here, we present the highly improved antiSMASH 2.0 release, available at http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/. For the new version, antiSMASH was entirely re-designed using a plug-and-play concept that allows easy integration of novel predictor or output modules. antiSMASH 2.0 now supports input of multiple related sequences simultaneously (multi-FASTA/GenBank/EMBL), which allows the analysis of draft genomes comprising multiple contigs. Moreover, direct analysis of protein sequences is now possible. antiSMASH 2.0 has also been equipped with the capacity to detect additional classes of secondary metabolites, including oligosaccharide antibiotics, phenazines, thiopeptides, homo-serine lactones, phosphonates and furans. The algorithm for predicting the core structure of the cluster end product is now also covering lantipeptides, in addition to polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides. The antiSMASH ClusterBlast functionality has been extended to identify sub-clusters involved in the biosynthesis of specific chemical building blocks. The new features currently make antiSMASH 2.0 the most comprehensive resource for identifying and analyzing novel secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23761447,ResponseNet2.0: Revealing signaling and regulatory pathways connecting your proteins and genes--now with human data.,"Genome sequencing and transcriptomic profiling are two widely used approaches for the identification of human disease pathways. However, each approach typically provides a limited view of disease pathways: Genome sequencing can identify disease-related mutations but rarely reveals their mode-of-action, while transcriptomic assays do not reveal the series of events that lead to the transcriptomic change. ResponseNet is an integrative network-optimization approach that we developed to fill these gaps by highlighting major signaling and regulatory molecular interaction paths that connect disease-related mutations and genes. The ResponseNet web-server provides a user-friendly interface to ResponseNet. Specifically, users can upload weighted lists of proteins and genes and obtain a sparse, weighted, molecular interaction subnetwork connecting them, that is biased toward regulatory and signaling pathways. ResponseNet2.0 enhances the functionality of the ResponseNet web-server in two important ways. First, it supports analysis of human data by offering a human interactome composed of proteins, genes and micro-RNAs. Second, it offers a new informative view of the output, including a randomization analysis, to help users assess the biological relevance of the output subnetwork.

In the traditional 2 structure, the center of the 23S rRNA is an extended single strand, which in 3D is seen to be compact and double helical. Accurately assigning nucleotides to helices compels a revision of the 23S rRNA 2 structure. Unlike the traditional 2 structure, the revised 2 structure of the 23S rRNA shows architectural similarity with the 16S rRNA. The revised 2 structure also reveals a clear relationship with the 3D structure and is generalizable to rRNAs of other species from all three domains of life. The 2 structure revision required us to reconsider the domain architecture. We partitioned the 23S rRNA into domains through analysis of molecular interactions, calculations of 2D folding propensities and compactness. The best domain model for the 23S rRNA contains seven domains, not six as previously ascribed. Domain 0 forms the core of the 23S rRNA, to which the other six domains are rooted. Editable 2 structures mapped with various data are provided (http://apollo.chemistry.gatech.edu/RibosomeGallery).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,kinda iffy
23812995,Compressive genomics for protein databases.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The exponential growth of protein sequence databases has increasingly made the fundamental question of searching for homologs a computational bottleneck. The amount of unique data, however, is not growing nearly as fast; we can exploit this fact to greatly accelerate homology search. Acceleration of programs in the popular PSI/DELTA-BLAST family of tools will not only speed-up homology search directly but also the huge collection of other current programs that primarily interact with large protein databases via precisely these tools.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a suite of homology search tools, powered by compressively accelerated protein BLAST (CaBLASTP), which are significantly faster than and comparably accurate with all known state-of-the-art tools, including HHblits, DELTA-BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Further, our tools are implemented in a manner that allows direct substitution into existing analysis pipelines. The key idea is that we introduce a local similarity-based compression scheme that allows us to operate directly on the compressed data. Importantly, CaBLASTP's runtime scales almost linearly in the amount of unique data, as opposed to current BLASTP variants, which scale linearly in the size of the full protein database being searched. Our compressive algorithms will speed-up many tasks, such as protein structure prediction and orthology mapping, which rely heavily on homology search.<h4>Availability</h4>CaBLASTP is available under the GNU Public License at http://cablastp.csail.mit.edu/<h4>Contact</h4>bab@mit.edu.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23813003,Using state machines to model the Ion Torrent sequencing process and to improve read error rates.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The importance of fast and affordable DNA sequencing methods for current day life sciences, medicine and biotechnology is hard to overstate. A major player is Ion Torrent, a pyrosequencing-like technology which produces flowgrams--sequences of incorporation values--which are converted into nucleotide sequences by a base-calling algorithm. Because of its exploitation of ubiquitous semiconductor technology and innovation in chemistry, Ion Torrent has been gaining popularity since its debut in 2011. Despite the advantages, however, Ion Torrent read accuracy remains a significant concern.<h4>Results</h4>We present FlowgramFixer, a new algorithm for converting flowgrams into reads. Our key observation is that the incorporation signals of neighboring flows, even after normalization and phase correction, carry considerable mutual information and are important in making the correct base-call. We therefore propose that base-calling of flowgrams should be done on a read-wide level, rather than one flow at a time. We show that this can be done in linear-time by combining a state machine with a Viterbi algorithm to find the nucleotide sequence that maximizes the likelihood of the observed flowgram. FlowgramFixer is applicable to any flowgram-based sequencing platform. We demonstrate FlowgramFixer's superior performance on Ion Torrent Escherichia coli data, with a 4.8% improvement in the number of high-quality mapped reads and a 7.1% improvement in the number of uniquely mappable reads.<h4>Availability</h4>Binaries and source code of FlowgramFixer are freely available at: http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~davidgo5/flowgramfixer.html.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23823315,"CluGene: A Bioinformatics Framework for the Identification of Co-Localized, Co-Expressed and Co-Regulated Genes Aimed at the Investigation of Transcriptional Regulatory Networks from High-Throughput Expression Data.","The full understanding of the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulatory networks requires unravelling of complex causal relationships. Genome high-throughput technologies produce a huge amount of information pertaining gene expression and regulation; however, the complexity of the available data is often overwhelming and tools are needed to extract and organize the relevant information. This work starts from the assumption that the observation of co-occurrent events (in particular co-localization, co-expression and co-regulation) may provide a powerful starting point to begin unravelling transcriptional regulatory networks. Co-expressed genes often imply shared functional pathways; co-expressed and functionally related genes are often co-localized, too; moreover, co-expressed and co-localized genes are also potential targets for co-regulation; finally, co-regulation seems more frequent for genes mapped to proximal chromosome regions. Despite the recognized importance of analysing co-occurrent events, no bioinformatics solution allowing the simultaneous analysis of co-expression, co-localization and co-regulation is currently available. Our work resulted in developing and valuating CluGene, a software providing tools to analyze multiple types of co-occurrences within a single interactive environment allowing the interactive investigation of combined co-expression, co-localization and co-regulation of genes. The use of CluGene will enhance the power of testing hypothesis and experimental approaches aimed at unravelling transcriptional regulatory networks.

23824634,Validating a Coarse-Grained Potential Energy Function through Protein Loop Modelling.,"Coarse-grained (CG) methods for sampling protein conformational space have the potential to increase computational efficiency by reducing the degrees of freedom. The gain in computational efficiency of CG methods often comes at the expense of non-protein like local conformational features. This could cause problems when transitioning to full atom models in a hierarchical framework. Here, a CG potential energy function was validated by applying it to the problem of loop prediction. A novel method to sample the conformational space of backbone atoms was benchmarked using a standard test set consisting of 351 distinct loops. This method used a sequence-independent CG potential energy function representing the protein using [Formula: see text]-carbon positions only and sampling conformations with a Monte Carlo simulated annealing based protocol. Backbone atoms were added using a method previously described and then gradient minimised in the Rosetta force field. Despite the CG potential energy function being sequence-independent, the method performed similarly to methods that explicitly use either fragments of known protein backbones with similar sequences or residue-specific [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]-maps to restrict the search space. The method was also able to predict with sub-Angstrom accuracy two out of seven loops from recently solved crystal structures of proteins with low sequence and structure similarity to previously deposited structures in the PDB. The ability to sample realistic loop conformations directly from a potential energy function enables the incorporation of additional geometric restraints and the use of more advanced sampling methods in a way that is not possible to do easily with fragment replacement methods and also enable multi-scale simulations for protein design and protein structure prediction. These restraints could be derived from experimental data or could be design restraints in the case of computational protein design.

23829391,An untargeted metabolomic workflow to improve structural characterization of metabolites.,"Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics relies on MS(2) data for structural characterization of metabolites. To obtain the high-quality MS(2) data necessary to support metabolite identifications, ions of interest must be purely isolated for fragmentation. Here, we show that metabolomic MS(2) data are frequently characterized by contaminating ions that prevent structural identification. Although using narrow-isolation windows can minimize contaminating MS(2) fragments, even narrow windows are not always selective enough, and they can complicate data analysis by removing isotopic patterns from MS(2) spectra. Moreover, narrow windows can significantly reduce sensitivity. In this work, we introduce a novel, two-part approach for performing metabolomic identifications that addresses these issues. First, we collect MS(2) scans with less stringent isolation settings to obtain improved sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Then, by evaluating MS(2) fragment intensities as a function of retention time and precursor mass targeted for MS(2) analysis, we obtain deconvolved MS(2) spectra that are consistent with pure standards and can therefore be used for metabolite identification. The value of our approach is highlighted with metabolic extracts from brain, liver, astrocytes, as well as nerve tissue, and performance is evaluated by using pure metabolite standards in combination with simulations based on raw MS(2) data from the METLIN metabolite database. A R package implementing the algorithms used in our workflow is available on our laboratory website ( http://pattilab.wustl.edu/decoms2.php ).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23851377,CoLIde: a bioinformatics tool for CO-expression-based small RNA Loci Identification using high-throughput sequencing data.,"Small RNAs (sRNAs) are 20-25 nt non-coding RNAs that act as guides for the highly sequence-specific regulatory mechanism known as RNA silencing. Due to the recent increase in sequencing depth, a highly complex and diverse population of sRNAs in both plants and animals has been revealed. However, the exponential increase in sequencing data has also made the identification of individual sRNA transcripts corresponding to biological units (sRNA loci) more challenging when based exclusively on the genomic location of the constituent sRNAs, hindering existing approaches to identify sRNA loci. To infer the location of significant biological units, we propose an approach for sRNA loci detection called CoLIde (Co-expression based sRNA Loci Identification) that combines genomic location with the analysis of other information such as variation in expression levels (expression pattern) and size class distribution. For CoLIde, we define a locus as a union of regions sharing the same pattern and located in close proximity on the genome. Biological relevance, detected through the analysis of size class distribution, is also calculated for each locus. CoLIde can be applied on ordered (e.g., time-dependent) or un-ordered (e.g., organ, mutant) series of samples both with or without biological/technical replicates. The method reliably identifies known types of loci and shows improved performance on sequencing data from both plants (e.g., A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum) and animals (e.g., D. melanogaster) when compared with existing locus detection techniques. CoLIde is available for use within the UEA Small RNA Workbench which can be downloaded from: http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23853063,Exhaustively characterizing feasible logic models of a signaling network using Answer Set Programming.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Logic modeling is a useful tool to study signal transduction across multiple pathways. Logic models can be generated by training a network containing the prior knowledge to phospho-proteomics data. The training can be performed using stochastic optimization procedures, but these are unable to guarantee a global optima or to report the complete family of feasible models. This, however, is essential to provide precise insight in the mechanisms underlaying signal transduction and generate reliable predictions.<h4>Results</h4>We propose the use of Answer Set Programming to explore exhaustively the space of feasible logic models. Toward this end, we have developed caspo, an open-source Python package that provides a powerful platform to learn and characterize logic models by leveraging the rich modeling language and solving technologies of Answer Set Programming. We illustrate the usefulness of caspo by revisiting a model of pro-growth and inflammatory pathways in liver cells. We show that, if experimental error is taken into account, there are thousands (11 700) of models compatible with the data. Despite the large number, we can extract structural features from the models, such as links that are always (or never) present or modules that appear in a mutual exclusive fashion. To further characterize this family of models, we investigate the input-output behavior of the models. We find 91 behaviors across the 11 700 models and we suggest new experiments to discriminate among them. Our results underscore the importance of characterizing in a global and exhaustive manner the family of feasible models, with important implications for experimental design.<h4>Availability</h4>caspo is freely available for download (license GPLv3) and as a web service at http://caspo.genouest.org/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.<h4>Contact</h4>santiago.videla@irisa.fr.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Main outcomes were 1) linear growth from 6 to 12 mo of age; 2) hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron [serum ferritin (SF)], and zinc status at 12 mo of age; and 3) meat intake at 12 mo of age (by using a food-frequency questionnaire).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 38 infants/group provided data at 12 mo of age. NGG infants had significantly higher red meat intake [mean  SD: 5.4  1.8 compared with 3.5  1.7 d/wk at 12 mo of age; P < 0.001), higher hemoglobin and hematocrit at 12 mo of age, and a significantly greater increase in hemoglobin (mean  SD change: 0.41  0.8 compared with -0.13  1.0; P = 0.01) and hematocrit (1.04  2.2 compared with -0.15  2.4; P = 0.03) from 6 to 12 mo of age than those in CG infants. There were no significant differences in linear growth from 6 to 12 mo of age or in SF or zinc.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new guidelines showed efficacy with higher red meat intake and positive effects on hemoglobin and hematocrit.

23956306,Incorporating prior knowledge into Gene Network Study.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>A major goal in genomic research is to identify genes that may jointly influence a biological response. From many years of intensive biomedical research, a large body of biological knowledge, or pathway information, has accumulated in available databases. There is a strong interest in leveraging these pathways to improve the statistical power and interpretability in studying gene networks associated with complex phenotypes. This prior information is a valuable complement to large-scale genomic data such as gene expression data generated from microarrays. However, it is a non-trivial task to effectively integrate available biological knowledge into gene expression data when reconstructing gene networks.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we developed and applied a Lasso method from a Bayesian perspective, a method we call prior Lasso (pLasso), for the reconstruction of gene networks. In this method, we partition edges between genes into two subsets: one subset of edges is present in known pathways, whereas the other has no prior information associated. Our method assigns different prior distributions to each subset according to a modified Bayesian information criterion that incorporates prior knowledge on both the network structure and the pathway information. Simulation studies have indicated that the method is more effective in recovering the underlying network than a traditional Lasso method that does not use the prior information. We applied pLasso to microarray gene expression datasets, where we used information from the Pathway Commons (PC) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as prior information for the network reconstruction, and successfully identified network hub genes associated with clinical outcome in cancer patients.<h4>Availability</h4>The source code is available at http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/homepage/liu/pLasso.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
23975194,A modular framework for gene set analysis integrating multilevel omics data.,"Modern high-throughput methods allow the investigation of biological functions across multiple 'omics' levels. Levels include mRNA and protein expression profiling as well as additional knowledge on, for example, DNA methylation and microRNA regulation. The reason for this interest in multi-omics is that actual cellular responses to different conditions are best explained mechanistically when taking all omics levels into account. To map gene products to their biological functions, public ontologies like Gene Ontology are commonly used. Many methods have been developed to identify terms in an ontology, overrepresented within a set of genes. However, these methods are not able to appropriately deal with any combination of several data types. Here, we propose a new method to analyse integrated data across multiple omics-levels to simultaneously assess their biological meaning. We developed a model-based Bayesian method for inferring interpretable term probabilities in a modular framework. Our Multi-level ONtology Analysis (MONA) algorithm performed significantly better than conventional analyses of individual levels and yields best results even for sophisticated models including mRNA fine-tuning by microRNAs. The MONA framework is flexible enough to allow for different underlying regulatory motifs or ontologies.

It contains two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and about 147 bp of DNA. The residues of the histone proteins are subject to numerous post-translational modifications, such as methylation or acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitiation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technique that provides genome-wide occupancy data of these modified histone proteins, and it requires appropriate computational methods.<h4>Results</h4>We present NucHunter, an algorithm that uses the data from ChIP-seq experiments directed against many histone modifications to infer positioned nucleosomes. NucHunter annotates each of these nucleosomes with the intensities of the histone modifications. We demonstrate that these annotations can be used to infer nucleosomal states with distinct correlations to underlying genomic features and chromatin-related processes, such as transcriptional start sites, enhancers, elongation by RNA polymerase II and chromatin-mediated repression. Thus, NucHunter is a versatile tool that can be used to predict positioned nucleosomes from a panel of histone modification ChIP-seq experiments and infer distinct histone modification patterns associated to different chromatin states.<h4>Availability</h4>The software is available at http://epigen.molgen.mpg.de/nuchunter/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Achievements in this area are expected to result in effective drug design (especially for HIV-1 protease inhibitors) against this life-threatening virus. However, some drawbacks (like the shortage of the available training data and the high dimensionality of the feature space) turn this task into a difficult classification problem. Thus, various machine learning techniques, and specifically several classification methods have been proposed in order to increase the accuracy of the classification model. In addition, for several classification problems, which are characterized by having few samples and many features, selecting the most relevant features is a major factor for increasing classification accuracy.<h4>Results</h4>We propose for HIV-1 data a consistency-based feature selection approach in conjunction with recursive feature elimination of support vector machines (SVMs). We used various classifiers for evaluating the results obtained from the feature selection process. We further demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing it with a state-of-the-art feature selection method applied on HIV-1 data, and we evaluated the reported results based on attributes which have been selected from different combinations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Applying feature selection on training data before realizing the classification task seems to be a reasonable data-mining process when working with types of data similar to HIV-1. On HIV-1 data, some feature selection or extraction operations in conjunction with different classifiers have been tested and noteworthy outcomes have been reported. These facts motivate for the work presented in this paper.<h4>Software availability</h4>The software is available at http://ozyer.etu.edu.tr/c-fs-svm.rar.

Guidelines in many countries have recommended that prior to invasive dental procedures antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis.<h4>Search methods</h4>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 21 January 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 21 January 2013). We searched for ongoing trials in the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Due to the low incidence of BE it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-control studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of antibiotic, compared to no such administration, before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those individuals at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping by whether prophylaxis was received or not. Included case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing an invasive dental procedure preceding the onset of endocarditis) with those at similar risk but who had not developed endocarditis. Outcomes of interest were mortality or serious adverse events requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse events to the antibiotics; and cost implications of the antibiotic provision for the care of those patients who developed endocarditis.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion then assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included study.<h4>Main results</h4>No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included. One case-control study met the inclusion criteria. It collected all the cases of endocarditis in the Netherlands over two years, finding a total of 24 people who developed endocarditis within 180 days of an invasive dental procedure, definitely requiring prophylaxis according to current guidelines, and who were at increased risk of endocarditis due to a pre-existing cardiac problem. This study included participants who died because of the endocarditis (using proxies). Controls attended local cardiology outpatient clinics for similar cardiac problems, had undergone an invasive dental procedure within the past 180 days, and were matched by age with the cases. No significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis could be seen. No data were found on other outcomes.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There remains no evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically, practitioners need to discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Eligible participants were continent men with an International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score of at least 18, scheduled to undergo nerve-sparing RP. Patients were randomized to a PVS group or a control group. Patients in the PVS group were instructed in using a PVS device (FERTI CARE() vibrator). Stimulation was performed at the frenulum once daily by the patients in their own homes for at least 1 week before surgery. After catheter removal, daily PVS was re-initiated for a period of 6 weeks. Participants were evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery with the IIEF-5 questionnaire and questions regarding urinary bother. Patients using up to one pad daily for security reasons only were considered continent. The study was registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ (NCT01067261).<h4>Results</h4>Data from 68 patients were available for analyses (30 patients randomized to PVS and 38 patients randomized to the control group). The IIEF-5 score was highest in the PVS group at all time points after surgery with a median score of 18 vs 7.5 in the control group at 12 months (P = 0.09), but the difference only reached borderline significance. At 12 months, 16/30 (53%) patients in the PVS group had reached an IIEF-5 score of at least 18, while this was the case for 12/38 (32%) patients in the control group (P = 0.07). There were no significant differences in the proportions of continent patients between groups at 3, 6 or 12 months. At 12 months 90% of the PVS patients were continent, while 94.7% of the control patients were continent (P = 0.46).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present study did not document a significant effect of PVS. However, the method proved to be acceptable for most patients and there was a trend towards better erectile function with PVS. More studies are needed to explore this possible effect further.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

24206655,Association of a polymorphism in PON-1 gene with steroid-induced osteonecrosis of femoral head in Chinese Han population.,"<h4>Background</h4>Treatment with steroids covers a wide spectrum of diseases in clinic. However, some users are suffering from serious side effects of steroid administration, while we enjoy the benefit it brings about. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a troublesome one among them. Recent studies have demonstrated that lipid metabolism disorder may play a vital role in pathogenesis of ONFH and mutation of the paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) gene may be involved in the occurrence of this disease. However, the relationship between polymorphisms of PON-1 and ONFH has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of this study was to determine whether PON-1 polymorphisms are associated with steroid-induced ONFH through a cohort study among Chinese Han population.<h4>Methods</h4>This trial applied a case-control scheme to compare the clinical data including PON-1 SNP among 94 patients and 106 control subjects to analyze the association between SNP and risk of steroid-induced ONFH. Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer is utilized for genotyping and the result was analyzed in multivariate analysis models.<h4>Results</h4>According to polymorphism test of rs662, its SNP was significantly associated with the risk of ONFH in overdominant analysis model [P value: 0.022; odds ratio (OR): 0.39]. However, genotype frequencies of rs662 of PON-1 gene between case and control group showed no differences (P > 0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data suggest for the first time that SNP (rs662) of the PON-1 gene was associated with the risk of steroid-induced ONFH. In addition, PAI-1 SNPs may play an important role in pathogenesis of ONFH.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticphatology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1501829501107336.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

However, publicly available tools dealing with the downstream analysis of genome-wide variants are fewer and have limited functionality. We developed SNPAAMapper, a novel variant analysis pipeline that can effectively classify variants by region (e.g. CDS, UTRs, intron, upstream, downstream), predict amino acid change type (e.g. synonymous, non-synonymous mutation), and prioritize mutation effects (e.g. CDS versus UTRs). Additional functionality afforded by our pipeline includes: checking variants at exon/intron junctions, customized homozygosity and allele frequency cutoff parameters, and annotation of known variants with dbSNP information, listing original and mutated amino acid sequences containing variants. The final result is reported in a spreadsheet format table containing all variant associated information and prioritized amino acids effects for investigators to examine.<h4>Availability</h4>Perl scripts and required input files are available on the web at http://www.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ccdu /SNPAAMapper.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
24259518,Quantitative proteomic profiling reveals novel region-specific markers in the adult mouse brain.,"Despite major advances in neuroscience, a comprehensive understanding of the structural and functional components of the adult brain compartments remains to be fully elucidated at a quantitative molecular level. Indeed, over half of the soluble- and membrane-annotated proteins are currently unmapped within online digital brain atlases. In this study, two complementary approaches were used to assess the unique repertoire of proteins enriched within select regions of the adult mouse CNS, including the brain stem, cerebellum, and remaining brain hemispheres. Of the 1200 proteins visualized by 2D-DIGE, approximately 150 (including cytosolic and membrane proteins) were found to exhibit statistically significant changes in relative abundance thus representing putative region-specific brain markers. In addition to using a high-precision (18) O-labeling strategy for the quantitative LC-MS/MS mapping of membrane proteins isolated from myelin-enriched fractions, we have identified over 1000 proteins that have yet to be described in any other mammalian myelin proteome. A comparison of our myelin proteome was made to an existing transcriptome database containing mRNA abundance profiles during oligodendrocyte differentiation and has confirmed statistically significant abundance changes for ~500 of these newly mapped proteins, thus revealing new roles in oligodendrocyte and myelin biology. These data offer a resource for the neuroscience community studying the molecular basis for specialized neuronal activities in the CNS and myelin-related disorders.

24307635,Comparative proteomics reveals key proteins recruited at the nucleoid of Deinococcus after irradiation-induced DNA damage.,"The nucleoids of radiation-resistant Deinococcus species show a high degree of compaction maintained after ionizing irradiation. We identified proteins recruited after irradiation in nucleoids of Deinococcus radiodurans and Deinococcus deserti by means of comparative proteomics. Proteins in nucleoid-enriched fractions from unirradiated and irradiated Deinococcus were identified and semiquantified by shotgun proteomics. The ssDNA-binding protein SSB, DNA gyrase subunits GyrA and GyrB, DNA topoisomerase I, RecA recombinase, UvrA excinuclease, RecQ helicase, DdrA, DdrB, and DdrD proteins were found in significantly higher amounts in irradiated nucleoids of both Deinococcus species. We observed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, the subcellular localization of these proteins in D. radiodurans, showing for the first time the recruitment of the DdrD protein into the D. radiodurans nucleoid. We specifically followed the kinetics of recruitment of RecA, DdrA, and DdrD to the nucleoid after irradiation. Remarkably, RecA proteins formed irregular filament-like structures 1 h after irradiation, before being redistributed throughout the cells by 3 h post-irradiation. Comparable dynamics of DdrD localization were observed, suggesting a possible functional interaction between RecA and DdrD. Several proteins involved in nucleotide synthesis were also seen in higher quantities in the nucleoids of irradiated cells, indicative of the existence of a mechanism for orchestrating the presence of proteins involved in DNA metabolism in nucleoids in response to massive DNA damage.

24312116,The power of regional heritability analysis for rare and common variant detection: simulations and application to eye biometrical traits.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of complex traits. However, they have explained relatively little trait heritability. Recently, we proposed a new analytical approach called regional heritability mapping (RHM) that captures more of the missing genetic variation. This method is applicable both to related and unrelated populations. Here, we demonstrate the power of RHM in comparison with single-SNP GWAS and gene-based association approaches under a wide range of scenarios with variable numbers of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with common and rare causal variants in a narrow genomic region. Simulations based on real genotype data were performed to assess power to capture QTL variance, and we demonstrate that RHM has greater power to detect rare variants and/or multiple alleles in a region than other approaches. In addition, we show that RHM can capture more accurately the QTL variance, when it is caused by multiple independent effects and/or rare variants. We applied RHM to analyze three biometrical eye traits for which single-SNP GWAS have been published or performed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in real data analysis and detected some additional loci which were not detected by other GWAS methods. RHM has the potential to explain some of missing heritability by capturing variance caused by QTL with low MAF and multiple independent QTL in a region, not captured by other GWAS methods. RHM analyses can be implemented using the software REACTA (http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/projects-portfolio/reacta).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

24334622,Metagenomic frameworks for monitoring antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments.,"<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput genomic technologies offer new approaches for environmental health monitoring, including metagenomic surveillance of antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs). Although natural environments serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes that can be transferred to pathogenic and human commensal bacteria, monitoring of these determinants has been infrequent and incomplete. Furthermore, surveillance efforts have not been integrated into public health decision making.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used a metagenomic epidemiology-based approach to develop an ARD index that quantifies antibiotic resistance potential, and we analyzed this index for common modal patterns across environmental samples. We also explored how metagenomic data such as this index could be conceptually framed within an early risk management context.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed 25 published data sets from shotgun pyrosequencing projects. The samples consisted of microbial community DNA collected from marine and freshwater environments across a gradient of human impact. We used principal component analysis to identify index patterns across samples.<h4>Results</h4>We observed significant differences in the overall index and index subcategory levels when comparing ecosystems more proximal versus distal to human impact. The selection of different sequence similarity thresholds strongly influenced the index measurements. Unique index subcategory modes distinguished the different metagenomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Broad-scale screening of ARD potential using this index revealed utility for framing environmental health monitoring and surveillance. This approach holds promise as a screening tool for establishing baseline ARD levels that can be used to inform and prioritize decision making regarding management of ARD sources and human exposure routes.<h4>Citation</h4>Port JA, Cullen AC, Wallace JC, Smith MN, Faustman EM. 2014.

A subtle and microscopically undetectable chromosomal alteration is uniparental disomy (UPD), which is known to be associated with distinct birth defects as per the chromosome involved and parental origin. UPD can be evident due to imprinted genes and/or activation of recessive mutations.<h4>Aims</h4>The present study comprises of data mining of published UPD cases with a focus on associated phenotypes. The goal was to identify non-random and recurrent associations between UPD and various genetic conditions, which can possibly indicate the presence of new imprinted genes.<h4>Settings and design</h4>Data mining was carried out using the homepage """"http://www.fish.uniklinikum-jena.de/UPD.html."""", an online catalog of published cases with UPD.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The UPD cases having normal karyotype and with or without clinical findings were selected to analyze the associated phenotypes for each chromosome, maternal or paternal involved in UPD.<h4>Results</h4>Our results revealed many genetic conditions (other than the known UPD syndromes) to be associated with UPD. Even in cases of bad obstetric history as well as normal individuals chance detection of UPD has been reported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The role of UPD in human genetic disorders needs to be studied by involving larger cohorts of individuals with birth defects as well as normal population. The genetic conditions were scrutinized in terms of inheritance patterns; majority of these were autosomal recessive indicating the role of UPD as an underlying mechanism.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
24367574,Switch of sensitivity dynamics revealed with DyGloSA toolbox for dynamical global sensitivity analysis as an early warning for system's critical transition.,"Systems with bifurcations may experience abrupt irreversible and often unwanted shifts in their performance, called critical transitions. For many systems like climate, economy, ecosystems it is highly desirable to identify indicators serving as early warnings of such regime shifts. Several statistical measures were recently proposed as early warnings of critical transitions including increased variance, autocorrelation and skewness of experimental or model-generated data. The lack of automatized tool for model-based prediction of critical transitions led to designing DyGloSA - a MATLAB toolbox for dynamical global parameter sensitivity analysis (GPSA) of ordinary differential equations models. We suggest that the switch in dynamics of parameter sensitivities revealed by our toolbox is an early warning that a system is approaching a critical transition. We illustrate the efficiency of our toolbox by analyzing several models with bifurcations and predicting the time periods when systems can still avoid going to a critical transition by manipulating certain parameter values, which is not detectable with the existing SA techniques. DyGloSA is based on the SBToolbox2 and contains functions, which compute dynamically the global sensitivity indices of the system by applying four main GPSA methods: eFAST, Sobol's ANOVA, PRCC and WALS. It includes parallelized versions of the functions enabling significant reduction of the computational time (up to 12 times). DyGloSA is freely available as a set of MATLAB scripts at http://bio.uni.lu/systems_biology/software/dyglosa. It requires installation of MATLAB (versions R2008b or later) and the Systems Biology Toolbox2 available at www.sbtoolbox2.org.

Videos illustrated aspects of language, sophistication of play and socialisation, cognition, and motor progress. Expert commentary, teaching text and summaries were used. A randomised controlled trial evaluated the resource. Paediatric trainees were recruited from The Sydney Children's Hospitals Network. Outcome measures were repeated at three time points (pre-teaching, immediate-post and 1 month) and included self-rated attitudes, knowledge of markers of development and observational expertise. Qualitative data on teaching usefulness were obtained through open-ended questions.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-six paediatric trainees (registrar 79%, women 82%; mean age 31 years) completed the pre-assessment, 46 the immediate-post and 45 the 1-month follow-up (20% attrition). Compared with the Control group, the Teaching group scored higher over time on markers of development (P = 0.006), observational expertise (P < 0.0001), confidence (P = 0.035) and satisfaction (P < 0.0001).

The data were used in quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling in order to annotate the CN. An algorithm is proposed to detect problematic molecules with large prediction errors, called outliers. In order to find an explanation for these large discrepancies between predicted and experimental values, these compounds were reanalyzed experimentally. As the first selected outliers indeed had experimental problems, including hydrolysis or sheer absence of expected structure, we herewith propose the use of QSPR as a support tool for quality control of screening data and encourage cooperation between experimental and theoretical teams to improve results.

24507755,Systematic characterization of small RNAome during zebrafish early developmental stages.,"<h4>Background</h4>During early vertebrate development, various small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) such as MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are dynamically expressed for orchestrating the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Systematic analysis of expression profiles of zebrafish small RNAome will be greatly helpful for understanding the sRNA regulation during embryonic development.<h4>Results</h4>We first determined the expression profiles of sRNAs during eight distinct stages of early zebrafish development by sRNA-seq technology. Integrative analyses with a new computational platform of CSZ (characterization of small RNAome for zebrafish) demonstrated an sRNA class transition from piRNAs to miRNAs as development proceeds. We observed that both the abundance and diversity of miRNAs are gradually increased, while the abundance is enhanced more dramatically than the diversity during development. However, although both the abundance and diversity of piRNAs are gradually decreased, the diversity was firstly increased then rapidly decreased. To evaluate the computational accuracy, the expression levels of four known miRNAs were experimentally validated. We also predicted 25 potentially novel miRNAs, whereas two candidates were verified by Northern blots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, our analyses revealed the piRNA to miRNA transition as a conserved mechanism in zebrafish, although two different types of sRNAs exhibit distinct expression dynamics in abundance and diversity, respectively. Our study not only generated a better understanding for sRNA regulations in early zebrafish development, but also provided a useful platform for analyzing sRNA-seq data.

24564522,Incorporating substrate sequence motifs and spatial amino acid composition to identify kinase-specific phosphorylation sites on protein three-dimensional structures.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial regulatory roles in cellular processes. Given the high-throughput mass spectrometry-based experiments, the desire to annotate the catalytic kinases for in vivo phosphorylation sites has motivated. Thus, a variety of computational methods have been developed for performing a large-scale prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites. However, most of the proposed methods solely rely on the local amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation sites. An increasing number of three-dimensional structures make it possible to physically investigate the structural environment of phosphorylation sites.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, all of the experimental phosphorylation sites are mapped to the protein entries of Protein Data Bank by sequence identity. It resulted in a total of 4508 phosphorylation sites containing the protein three-dimensional (3D) structures. To identify phosphorylation sites on protein 3D structures, this work incorporates support vector machines (SVMs) with the information of linear motifs and spatial amino acid composition, which is determined for each kinase group by calculating the relative frequencies of 20 amino acid types within a specific radial distance from central phosphorylated amino acid residue. After the cross-validation evaluation, most of the kinase-specific models trained with the consideration of structural information outperform the models considering only the sequence information. Furthermore, the independent testing set which is not included in training set has demonstrated that the proposed method could provide a comparable performance to other popular tools.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed method is shown to be capable of predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites on 3D structures and has been implemented as a web server which is freely accessible at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/PhosK3D/. Due to the difficulty of identifying the kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with similar sequenced motifs, this work also integrates the 3D structural information to improve the cross classifying specificity.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not found

BRAF(V600E) mutation and DNA methylation are useful markers to distinguish malignant thyroid neoplasm from benign. The aim of this study was to determine whether combined detection of BRAF(V600E) mutation and methylation markers on FNABs could improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Using pyrosequencing and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) methods, FNABs from 79 and 38 patients with thyroid nodules in training and test groups, respectively, were analyzed for BRAF(V600E) mutation and gene methylation.<h4>Results</h4>BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 30/42 (71.4%) and 14/20 (70%) FNABs in training and test groups, respectively. All BRAF(V600E)-positive samples were histologically diagnosed as papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) after thyroidectomy. As expected, BRAF mutation was not found in all benign nodules. Moreover, we demonstrated that the five genes, including CALCA, DAPK1, TIMP3, RAR-beta and RASSF1A, were aberrantly methylated in FNABs. Of them, methylation level of DAPK1 in PTCs was significantly higher than that in benign samples (P <0.0001). Conversely, methylation level of RASSF1A in PTCs was significantly lower than that in benign samples (P =0.003). Notably, compared with BRAF mutation testing alone, combined detection of BRAF mutation and methylation markers increased the diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of PTC with excellent specificity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our data have demonstrated that combine analysis of BRAF mutation and DNA methylation markers on FNABs may be a useful strategy to facilitate the diagnosis of malignant thyroid neoplasm, particularly PTC.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/6080878071149177.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
24611578,Variation in surgical quality measure adherence within hospital referral regions: do publicly reported surgical quality measures distinguish among hospitals that patients are likely to compare?,"<h4>Objective</h4>To determine whether surgical quality measures that Medicare publicly reports provide a basis for patients to choose a hospital from within their geographic region.<h4>Data source</h4>The Department of Health and Human Services' public reporting website, http://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare.<h4>Study design</h4>We identified hospitals (n=2,953) reporting adherence rates to the quality measures intended to reduce surgical site infections (Surgical Care Improvement Project, 1-3) in 2012. We defined regions within which patients were likely to compare hospitals using the hospital referral regions (HRRs) from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care Project. We described distributions of reported SCIP adherence within each HRR, including medians, interquartile ranges (IQRs), skewness, and outliers.<h4>Principal findings</h4>Ninety-seven percent of HRRs had median SCIP-1 scores =95 percent. In 93 percent of HRRs, half of the hospitals in the HRR were within 5 percent of the median hospital's score. In 62 percent of HRRs, hospitals were skewed toward the higher rates (negative skewness). Seven percent of HRRs demonstrated positive skewness. Only 1 percent had a positive outlier. SCIP-2 and SCIP-3 demonstrated similar distributions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Publicly reported quality measures for surgical site infection prevention do not distinguish the majority of hospitals that patients are likely to choose from when selecting a surgical provider. More studies are needed to improve public reporting's ability to positively impact patient decision making.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
24700317,Fast alignment-free sequence comparison using spaced-word frequencies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Alignment-free methods for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome analysis and phylogeny reconstruction; they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment-based approaches. In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent.<h4>Results</h4>To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use 'spaced words', defined by patterns of 'match' and 'don't care' positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our program is freely available at http://spaced.gobics.de/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
24737859,"The influence of dynein processivity control, MAPs, and microtubule ends on directional movement of a localising mRNA.","Many cellular constituents travel along microtubules in association with multiple copies of motor proteins. How the activity of these motors is regulated during cargo sorting is poorly understood. In this study, we address this issue using a novel in vitro assay for the motility of localising Drosophila mRNAs bound to native dynein-dynactin complexes. High precision tracking reveals that individual RNPs within a population undergo either diffusive, or highly processive, minus end-directed movements along microtubules. RNA localisation signals stimulate the processive movements, with regulation of dynein-dynactin's activity rather than its total copy number per RNP, responsible for this effect. Our data support a novel mechanism for multi-motor translocation based on the regulation of dynein processivity by discrete cargo-associated features. Studying the in vitro responses of RNPs to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and microtubule ends provides insights into how an RNA population could navigate the cytoskeletal network and become anchored at its destination in cells.

The goal of this study is to determine whether clinical cross-reactivity can be identified from primary protein sequences in allergy epitopes and food proteins.<h4>Methods</h4>High-throughput analysis was performed by assembling all known allergy epitopes within the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB; http://www.iedb.org) for 5 common species from 5 inhalant allergen subclasses and comparing their protein sequences to each other, as well as to sequences of intact proteins from known cross-reactive foods in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) protein database (http://www.uniprot.org) that have been implicated in OAS. Computational methods were employed to allow for exact matching, gaps, and similar amino acids using multiple algorithms. A phylogenetic tree was created to determine evolutionary relationships between cross-reactive epitopes in OAS.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-three common inhalant allergens had 4429 unique epitopes; the 19 foods implicated in OAS had 9497 protein sequences. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm identified interclass and intraclass sequence similarities for the 5 inhalant allergy classes with high similarity for mites, grasses, and trees. Analysis of OAS proteins identified 104 matches to inhalant allergy epitopes that are known to cross-react. The phylogenetic tree displayed relationships that mostly followed organism phylogeny.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Use of primary protein sequences was successful in explaining clinical allergy cross-reactivity. Clinical correlation is needed for use of these epitopes as diagnostic or therapeutic entities for patients with cross-reactive allergic disease.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not about the resource

The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the feasibility of linking students from North America and Europe with a peer-to-peer learning approach.<h4>Methods</h4>Face and content validity studies were completed on the previously designed and validated online repository http://www.pilgrimshospital.com. Four medical students from the University of Toronto, Canada, were paired with four students from University College Cork, Ireland. Each student was invited to upload two pieces of information learned from a senior colleague that day. Each student was asked to review the information uploaded by their partner, editing with references if needed. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the e-peer system were conducted.<h4>Results</h4>Over the study period, the system recorded a total of 10 079 individual page views. Questionnaires completed by participants demonstrated that 6/8 found the system either """"very easy"""" or """"easy"""" to use, whereas all found that the system promoted evidenced-based and self-directed learning. Structured interviews revealed 3 main themes: The Peer Connection, Trust in Data Veracity, and Aid to Clinical Learning.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This pilot study demonstrates it is feasible to link students from separate continents in a community of peer-to-peer learning. This is viewed positively by students and enhances evidenced-based learning, and the aspect of peer connectivity was important to participating students. Such an approach encourages peer cooperation and has the potential to disseminate key clinical learning experiences widely.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,out of scope
24843014,APOBEC3A deaminates transiently exposed single-strand DNA during LINE-1 retrotransposition.,"Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes. Human cells have therefore evolved strategies to regulate L1 retrotransposition. The APOBEC3 (A3) gene family consists of seven enzymes that catalyze deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides (C-to-U) in single-strand DNA substrates. Among these enzymes, APOBEC3A (A3A) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retrotransposition in cultured cell assays. However, previous characterization of L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A did not yield evidence of deamination. Thus, the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained enigmatic. Here, we have used in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. These data provide a mechanistic explanation of how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02008.001.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
24849626,The inhibitory microcircuit of the substantia nigra provides feedback gain control of the basal ganglia output.,"Dysfunction of the basal ganglia produces severe deficits in the timing, initiation, and vigor of movement. These diverse impairments suggest a control system gone awry. In engineered systems, feedback is critical for control. By contrast, models of the basal ganglia highlight feedforward circuitry and ignore intrinsic feedback circuits. In this study, we show that feedback via axon collaterals of substantia nigra projection neurons control the gain of the basal ganglia output. Through a combination of physiology, optogenetics, anatomy, and circuit mapping, we elaborate a general circuit mechanism for gain control in a microcircuit lacking interneurons. Our data suggest that diverse tonic firing rates, weak unitary connections and a spatially diffuse collateral circuit with distinct topography and kinetics from feedforward input is sufficient to implement divisive feedback inhibition. The importance of feedback for engineered systems implies that the intranigral microcircuit, despite its absence from canonical models, could be essential to basal ganglia function.

Malaria distribution in Pakistan is heterogeneous, and some areas, including Punjab, are considered at low risk for malaria. The aim of this study is to describe the trend of imported malaria cases from Pakistan reported to the international surveillance systems from 2005 to 2012.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinics reporting malaria cases acquired after a stay in Pakistan between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, were identified from the GeoSentinel (http://www.geosentinel.org) and EuroTravNet (http://www.Eurotravnet.eu) networks. Demographic and travel-related information was retrieved from the database and further information such as areas of destination within Pakistan was obtained directly from the reporting sites. Standard linear regression models were used to assess the statistical significance of the time trend.<h4>Results</h4>From January 2005 to December 2012, a total of 63 cases of malaria acquired in Pakistan were retrieved in six countries over three continents. A statistically significant increasing trend in imported Plasmodium vivax malaria cases acquired in Pakistan, particularly for those exposed in Punjab, was observed over time (p = 0.006).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our observation may herald a variation in malaria incidence in the Punjab province of Pakistan. This is in contrast with the previously described decreasing incidence of malaria in travelers to the Indian subcontinent, and with reports that describe Punjab as a low risk area for malaria. Nevertheless, this event is considered plausible by international organizations. This has potential implications for changes in chemoprophylaxis options and reinforces the need for increased surveillance, also considering the risk of introduction of autochthonous P. vivax malaria in areas where competent vectors are present, such as Europe.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource
24965847,H-DROP: an SVM based helical domain linker predictor trained with features optimized by combining random forest and stepwise selection.,"Domain linker prediction is attracting much interest as it can help identifying novel domains suitable for high throughput proteomics analysis. Here, we report H-DROP, an SVM-based Helical Domain linker pRediction using OPtimal features. H-DROP is, to the best of our knowledge, the first predictor for specifically and effectively identifying helical linkers. This was made possible first because a large training dataset became available from IS-Dom, and second because we selected a small number of optimal features from a huge number of potential ones. The training helical linker dataset, which included 261 helical linkers, was constructed by detecting helical residues at the boundary regions of two independent structural domains listed in our previously reported IS-Dom dataset. 45 optimal feature candidates were selected from 3,000 features by random forest, which were further reduced to 26 optimal features by stepwise selection. The prediction sensitivity and precision of H-DROP were 35.2 and 38.8%, respectively. These values were over 10.7% higher than those of control methods including our previously developed DROP, which is a coil linker predictor, and PPRODO, which is trained with un-differentiated domain boundary sequences. Overall, these results indicated that helical linkers can be predicted from sequence information alone by using a strictly curated training data set for helical linkers and carefully selected set of optimal features.

Our aim was to assess current levels of evidence (LE) according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine ( http://www.cebm.net/?O=1025 ) regarding the oncologic benefits of PND. Data were analyzed via MEDLINE keywords: PTC, differentiated thyroid carcinoma, PND, central lymph node metastases, central compartment, recurrence-free survival. There was conflicting evidence regarding the rate of reoperation for recurrence, with some studies showing a lower rate after PND with increased recurrence-free survival and a higher rate of undetectable pre- and post-ablation thyroglobulin levels (LE 4), whereas other studies did not show a difference (LE 4). Only one study (LE 4) showed improved disease-specific survival with PND. PND may improve recurrence-free survival, although this is supported by only a low LE. Current recommendations can only be based on low-level evidence.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Teams were organized in a triad comprised of a senior researcher, a new researcher, and a 'research user' from government, health services, or other organizations with the authority or capacity to apply the research findings. Multiple regional and global team capacity-enhancement meetings were organized to refine methods and to discuss and assess cross-case findings.<h4>Objective</h4>Most research projects used mixed methods, incorporating analyses of qualitative data (interviews and focus groups), secondary data, and key policy and program documents. Some incorporated historical case study analyses, and a few undertook new surveys. The synthesis of findings in this report was derived through qualitative analysis of final project reports undertaken by three different reviewers.<h4>Results</h4>Evidence of comprehensiveness (defined in this research program as efforts to improve equity in access, community empowerment and participation, social and environmental health determinants, and intersectoral action) was found in many of the cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the important contextual differences amongst the different country studies, the similarity of many of their findings, often generated using mixed methods, attests to certain transferable health systems characteristics to create and sustain CPHC practices. These include:1. Well-trained and supported community health workers (CHWs) able to work effectively with marginalized communities2. Effective mechanisms for community participation, both informal (through participation in projects and programs, and meaningful consultation) and formal (though program management structures)3.

Despite developments in the network inference, current methods are still limited in identifying temporal transition of structures of PPI networks, DRPs associated with the structural transition and the interplays among the DRPs over time.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a probabilistic model for estimating Time-Evolving differential PPI networks with MultiPle Information (TEMPI). This model describes probabilistic relationships among network structures, time-course gene expression data and Gene Ontology biological processes (GOBPs). By maximizing the likelihood of the probabilistic model, TEMPI estimates jointly the time-evolving differential PPI networks (TDNs) describing temporal transition of PPI network structures together with serial activation of DRPs associated with transiting networks. This joint estimation enables us to interpret the TDNs in terms of temporal transition of the DRPs. To demonstrate the utility of TEMPI, we applied it to two time-course datasets. TEMPI identified the TDNs that correctly delineated temporal transition of DRPs and time-dependent associations between the DRPs. These TDNs provide hypotheses for mechanisms underlying serial activation of key DRPs and their temporal associations.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code and sample data files are available at http://sbm.postech.ac.kr/tempi/sources.zip.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,sample data only

Additionally, the observation of molecular crowding leads to the insight that even a high number of copies of species do not guarantee their interaction. How single particles contribute to stabilizing biological systems is not well understood yet. Hence, we aim at determining the influence of single molecules on the long-term behaviour of biological systems, i.e. whether they can reach a steady state.<h4>Results</h4>We provide theoretical considerations and a tool to analyse Systems Biology Markup Language models for the possibility to stabilize because of the described effects. The theory is an extension of chemical organization theory, which we called discrete chemical organization theory. Furthermore we scanned the BioModels Database for the occurrence of discrete chemical organizations.

The 5th National Audit Project was designed to investigate the reported incidence, predisposing factors, causality and impact of accidental awareness. A nationwide network of local co-ordinators across all UK and Irish public hospitals reported all new patient reports of accidental awareness to a central database, using a system of monthly anonymised reporting over a calendar year. The database collected the details of the reported event, anaesthetic and surgical technique, and any sequelae. These reports were categorised into main types by a multidisciplinary panel, using a formalised process of analysis. The main categories of accidental awareness were: certain or probable; possible; during sedation; on or from the intensive care unit; could not be determined; unlikely; drug errors; and statement only. The degree of evidence to support the categorisation was also defined for each report. Patient experience and sequelae were categorised using current tools or modifications of such. The 5th National Audit Project methodology may be used to assess new reports of accidental awareness during general anaesthesia in a standardised manner, especially for the development of an ongoing database of case reporting.

In recent years, the number of network reconstructions has been constantly increasing, mostly because of the availability of novel (semi-)automated procedures, which enabled the reconstruction of metabolic models based on individual genomes and their annotation. The resulting models are widely used in numerous applications. However, the accuracy and predictive power of network reconstructions are commonly limited by inherent inconsistencies and gaps.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present a novel method to validate metabolic network reconstructions based on the concept of autocatalytic sets. Autocatalytic sets correspond to collections of metabolites that, besides enzymes and a growth medium, are required to produce all biomass components in a metabolic model. These autocatalytic sets are well-conserved across all domains of life, and their identification in specific genome-scale reconstructions allows us to draw conclusions about potential inconsistencies in these models. The method is capable of detecting inconsistencies, which are neglected by other gap-finding methods. We tested our method on the Model SEED, which is the largest repository for automatically generated genome-scale network reconstructions. In this way, we were able to identify a significant number of missing pathways in several of these reconstructions. Hence, the method we report represents a powerful tool to identify inconsistencies in large-scale metabolic networks.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The method is available as source code on http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/~m3kach/ASBIG/ASBIG.zip.<h4>Contact</h4>christoph.kaleta@uni-jena.de<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25322794,A novel algorithm for the precise calculation of the maximal information coefficient.,"Measuring associations is an important scientific task. A novel measurement method maximal information coefficient (MIC) was proposed to identify a broad class of associations. As foreseen by its authors, MIC implementation algorithm ApproxMaxMI is not always convergent to real MIC values. An algorithm called SG (Simulated annealing and Genetic) was developed to facilitate the optimal calculation of MIC, and the convergence of SG was proved based on Markov theory. When run on fruit fly data set including 1,000,000 pairs of gene expression profiles, the mean squared difference between SG and the exhaustive algorithm is 0.00075499, compared with 0.1834 in the case of ApproxMaxMI.

25329667,Accurate assignment of significance to neuropeptide identifications using Monte Carlo k-permuted decoy databases.,"In support of accurate neuropeptide identification in mass spectrometry experiments, novel Monte Carlo permutation testing was used to compute significance values. Testing was based on k-permuted decoy databases, where k denotes the number of permutations. These databases were integrated with a range of peptide identification indicators from three popular open-source database search software (OMSSA, Crux, and X! Tandem) to assess the statistical significance of neuropeptide spectra matches. Significance p-values were computed as the fraction of the sequences in the database with match indicator value better than or equal to the true target spectra. When applied to a test-bed of all known manually annotated mouse neuropeptides, permutation tests with k-permuted decoy databases identified up to 100% of the neuropeptides at p-value < 10(-5). The permutation test p-values using hyperscore (X! Tandem), E-value (OMSSA) and Sp score (Crux) match indicators outperformed all other match indicators. The robust performance to detect peptides of the intuitive indicator """"number of matched ions between the experimental and theoretical spectra"""" highlights the importance of considering this indicator when the p-value was borderline significant. Our findings suggest permutation decoy databases of size 1105 are adequate to accurately detect neuropeptides and this can be exploited to increase the speed of the search. The straightforward Monte Carlo permutation testing (comparable to a zero order Markov model) can be easily combined with existing peptide identification software to enable accurate and effective neuropeptide detection.

25340248,"Head Injury: Triage, Assessment, Investigation and Early Management of Head Injury in Children, Young People and Adults","For the purposes of this guideline, head injury is defined as any trauma to the head other than superficial injuries to the face. Head injury is the commonest cause of death and disability in people aged 140 years in the UK. Data for head injury are recorded in the Hospital Episode Statistics (http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes). Each year, 1.4 million people attend emergency departments in England and Wales with a recent head injury. Between 33% and 50% of these are children aged under 15 years. Annually, about 200,000 people are admitted to hospital with head injury. Of these, one-fifth have features suggesting skull fracture or have evidence of brain damage. Most patients recover without specific or specialist intervention, but others experience long-term disability or even die from the effects of complications that could potentially be minimised or avoided with early detection and appropriate treatment. The incidence of death from head injury is low, with as few as 0.2% of all patients attending emergency departments with a head injury dying as a result of this injury. Ninety five per cent of people who have sustained a head injury present with a normal or minimally impaired conscious level (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] greater than 12) but the majority of fatal outcomes are in the moderate (GCS 912) or severe (GCS 8 or less) head injury groups, which account for only 5% of attenders. Therefore, emergency departments see a large number of patients with minor or mild head injuries and need to identify the very small number who will go on to have serious acute intracranial complications. It is estimated that 2530% of children aged under 2 years who are hospitalised with head injury have an abusive head injury. This guideline has updated some of the terminology used in relation to safeguarding children and vulnerable adults. The previous head injury guideline produced by NICE in 2003 (NICE clinical guideline 4) and updated in 2007 (NICE clinical guideline 56) resulted in CT scanning replacing skull radiography as the primary imaging modality for assessing head injury. It also led to an increase in the proportion of people with severe head injury having their care managed in specialist centres. This has been associated with a decline in fatality among patients with severe head injury. This update is needed because of the continuing importance of up-to-date evidence-based guidance on the initial assessment and early management of head injury. Appropriate guidance can enable early detection and treatment of life-threatening brain injury, where present, but also early discharge of patients with negligible risk of brain injury. It can therefore save lives while at the same time preventing needless crowding in emergency departments and observation wards. Further key NHS changes have driven the scope of this update. These include the introduction in 2012 of regional trauma networks with major trauma triage tools within NHS England; the extension of indications for anticoagulation therapy; the expanding use of biomarkers to guide emergent clinical management in other conditions, such as chest pain; and the establishment of local safeguarding boards. The last of these addresses the requirement for front-line clinical staff to assess not only the severity of the head injury but also why it occurred.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,clinical
25341068,"Udock, the interactive docking entertainment system.","Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in biological processes. Protein docking calculations' goal is to predict, given two proteins of known structures, the associate conformation of the corresponding complex. Here, we present a new interactive protein docking system, Udock, that makes use of users' cognitive capabilities added up. In Udock, the users tackle simplified representations of protein structures and explore protein-protein interfaces' conformational space using a gamified interactive docking system with on the fly scoring. We assumed that if given appropriate tools, a nave user's cognitive capabilities could provide relevant data for (1) the prediction of correct interfaces in binary protein complexes and (2) the identification of the experimental partner in interaction among a set of decoys. To explore this approach experimentally, we conducted a preliminary two week long playtest where the registered users could perform a cross-docking on a dataset comprising 4 binary protein complexes. The users explored almost all the surface of the proteins that were available in the dataset but favored certain regions that seemed more attractive as potential docking spots. These favored regions were located inside or nearby the experimental binding interface for 5 out of the 8 proteins in the dataset. For most of them, the best scores were obtained with the experimental partner. The alpha version of Udock is freely accessible at http://udock.fr.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25344501,iDoComp: a compression scheme for assembled genomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the release of the latest next-generation sequencing (NGS) machine, the HiSeq X by Illumina, the cost of sequencing a Human has dropped to a mere $4000. Thus we are approaching a milestone in the sequencing history, known as the $1000 genome era, where the sequencing of individuals is affordable, opening the doors to effective personalized medicine. Massive generation of genomic data, including assembled genomes, is expected in the following years. There is crucial need for compression of genomes guaranteed of performing well simultaneously on different species, from simple bacteria to humans, which will ease their transmission, dissemination and analysis. Further, most of the new genomes to be compressed will correspond to individuals of a species from which a reference already exists on the database. Thus, it is natural to propose compression schemes that assume and exploit the availability of such references.<h4>Results</h4>We propose iDoComp, a compressor of assembled genomes presented in FASTA format that compresses an individual genome using a reference genome for both the compression and the decompression. In terms of compression efficiency, iDoComp outperforms previously proposed algorithms in most of the studied cases, with comparable or better running time. For example, we observe compression gains of up to 60% in several cases, including H.sapiens data, when comparing with the best compression performance among the previously proposed algorithms.<h4>Availability</h4>iDoComp is written in C and can be downloaded from: http://www.stanford.edu/~iochoa/iDoComp.html (We also provide a full explanation on how to run the program and an example with all the necessary files to run it.).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Although many research groups have independently dedicated their efforts to developing software tools for visualizing and analyzing these data, these tools are often not compatible with each other because of different data formats.<h4>Results</h4>We developed an open unified format, Biological Dynamics Markup Language (BDML; current version: 0.2), which provides a basic framework for representing quantitative biological dynamics data for objects ranging from molecules to cells to organisms. BDML is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML). Its advantages are machine and human readability and extensibility.

We present a web patient empowering system (PHSP4) that ensures continuous monitoring and assessment of the health state of patients with DM (type I and II). PHSP4 is a Knowledge-Based Personal Health System (PHS) which follows the trend of P4 Medicine (Personalized, Predictive, Preventive, and Participative). It provides messages to outpatients and clinicians about the achievement of objectives, follow-up, and treatments adjusted to the patient condition. Additionally, it calculates a four-component risk vector of the associated pathologies with DM: Nephropathy, Diabetic retinopathy, Diabetic foot, and Cardiovascular event. The core of the system is a Rule-Based System which Knowledge Base is composed by a set of rules implementing the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (American Diabetes Association: http://www.diabetes.org/ ) clinical guideline. The PHSP4 is designed to be standardized and to facilitate its interoperability by means of terminologies (SNOMED-CT [The International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization: http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/ ] and UCUM [The Unified Code for Units of Measure: http://unitsofmeasure.org/ ]), standardized clinical documents (HL7 CDA R2 [Health Level Seven International: http://www.hl7.org/index.cfm ]) for managing Electronic Health Record (EHR). We have evaluated the functionality of the system and its users' acceptance of the system using simulated and real data, and a questionnaire based in the Technology Acceptance Model methodology (TAM).

25429060,A bio-inspired computing model for ovarian carcinoma classification and oncogene detection.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the western world for 2013. In ovarian cancer, benign tumors turn malignant, but the point of transition is difficult to predict and diagnose. The 5-year survival rate of all types of ovarian cancer is 44%, but this can be improved to 92% if the cancer is found and treated before it spreads beyond the ovary. However, only 15% of all ovarian cancers are found at this early stage. Therefore, the ability to automatically identify and diagnose ovarian cancer precisely and efficiently as the tissue changes from benign to invasive is important for clinical treatment and for increasing the cure rate. This study proposes a new ovarian carcinoma classification model using two algorithms: a novel discretization of food sources for an artificial bee colony (DfABC), and a support vector machine (SVM). For the first time in the literature, oncogene detection using this method is also investigated.<h4>Results</h4>A novel bio-inspired computing model and hybrid algorithms combining DfABC and SVM was applied to ovarian carcinoma and oncogene classification. This study used the human ovarian cDNA expression database to collect 41 patient samples and 9600 genes in each pathological stage. Feature selection methods were used to detect and extract 15 notable oncogenes. We then used the DfABC-SVM model to examine these 15 oncogenes, dividing them into eight different classifications according to their gene expressions of various pathological stages. The average accuracyof the eight classification experiments was 94.76%. This research also found some oncogenes that had not been discovered or indicated in previous scientific studies. The main contribution of this research is the proof that these newly discovered oncogenes are highly related to ovarian or other cancers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://mht.mis.nchu.edu.tw/moodle/course/view.php?id=7.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

It is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of hard ticks, Ixodes spp. Although antibiotic treatments are efficient in the early stage of the infection, a significant number of patients develop disseminated manifestations (articular, neurological, and cutaneous) due to unnoticed or absence of erythema migrans, or to inappropriate treatment. Vaccine could be an efficient approach to decrease Lyme disease incidence. We have developed a proteomic approach based on a one dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by LC-MS/MS strategy to identify new vaccine candidates. We analyzed a disseminating clone and the associated wild-type strain for each major pathogenic Borrelia species: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii. We identified specific proteins and common proteins to the disseminating clones of the three main species. In parallel, we used a spectral counting strategy to identify upregulated proteins common to the clones. Finally, 40 proteins were found that could potentially be involved in bacterial virulence and of interest in the development of a new vaccine. We selected the three proteins specifically detected in the disseminating clones of the three Borrelia species and checked by RT-PCR whether they are expressed in mouse skin upon B. burgdorferi ss inoculation. Interestingly, BB0566 appears as a potential vaccine candidate.

25480679,Marky: a tool supporting annotation consistency in multi-user and iterative document annotation projects.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Document annotation is a key task in the development of Text Mining methods and applications. High quality annotated corpora are invaluable, but their preparation requires a considerable amount of resources and time. Although the existing annotation tools offer good user interaction interfaces to domain experts, project management and quality control abilities are still limited. Therefore, the current work introduces Marky, a new Web-based document annotation tool equipped to manage multi-user and iterative projects, and to evaluate annotation quality throughout the project life cycle.<h4>Methods</h4>At the core, Marky is a Web application based on the open source CakePHP framework. User interface relies on HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. Rangy library assists in browser-independent implementation of common DOM range and selection tasks, and Ajax and JQuery technologies are used to enhance user-system interaction.<h4>Results</h4>Marky grants solid management of inter- and intra-annotator work. Most notably, its annotation tracking system supports systematic and on-demand agreement analysis and annotation amendment. Each annotator may work over documents as usual, but all the annotations made are saved by the tracking system and may be further compared. So, the project administrator is able to evaluate annotation consistency among annotators and across rounds of annotation, while annotators are able to reject or amend subsets of annotations made in previous rounds. As a side effect, the tracking system minimises resource and time consumption.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Marky is a novel environment for managing multi-user and iterative document annotation projects. Compared to other tools, Marky offers a similar visually intuitive annotation experience while providing unique means to minimise annotation effort and enforce annotation quality, and therefore corpus consistency.

25495213,Genotype harmonizer: automatic strand alignment and format conversion for genotype data integration.,"<h4>Background</h4>To gain statistical power or to allow fine mapping, researchers typically want to pool data before meta-analyses or genotype imputation. However, the necessary harmonization of genetic datasets is currently error-prone because of many different file formats and lack of clarity about which genomic strand is used as reference.<h4>Findings</h4>Genotype Harmonizer (GH) is a command-line tool to harmonize genetic datasets by automatically solving issues concerning genomic strand and file format. GH solves the unknown strand issue by aligning ambiguous A/T and G/C SNPs to a specified reference, using linkage disequilibrium patterns without prior knowledge of the used strands. GH supports many common GWAS/NGS genotype formats including PLINK, binary PLINK, VCF, SHAPEIT2 & Oxford GEN. GH is implemented in Java and a large part of the functionality can also be used as Java 'Genotype-IO' API. All software is open source under license LGPLv3 and available from http://www.molgenis.org/systemsgenetics.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GH can be used to harmonize genetic datasets across different file formats and can be easily integrated as a step in routine meta-analysis and imputation pipelines.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25541969,Scholarly context not found: one in five articles suffers from reference rot.,"The emergence of the web has fundamentally affected most aspects of information communication, including scholarly communication. The immediacy that characterizes publishing information to the web, as well as accessing it, allows for a dramatic increase in the speed of dissemination of scholarly knowledge. But, the transition from a paper-based to a web-based scholarly communication system also poses challenges. In this paper, we focus on reference rot, the combination of link rot and content drift to which references to web resources included in Science, Technology, and Medicine (STM) articles are subject. We investigate the extent to which reference rot impacts the ability to revisit the web context that surrounds STM articles some time after their publication. We do so on the basis of a vast collection of articles from three corpora that span publication years 1997 to 2012. For over one million references to web resources extracted from over 3.5 million articles, we determine whether the HTTP URI is still responsive on the live web and whether web archives contain an archived snapshot representative of the state the referenced resource had at the time it was referenced. We observe that the fraction of articles containing references to web resources is growing steadily over time. We find one out of five STM articles suffering from reference rot, meaning it is impossible to revisit the web context that surrounds them some time after their publication. When only considering STM articles that contain references to web resources, this fraction increases to seven out of ten. We suggest that, in order to safeguard the long-term integrity of the web-based scholarly record, robust solutions to combat the reference rot problem are required. In conclusion, we provide a brief insight into the directions that are explored with this regard in the context of the Hiberlink project.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25555998,Fiber estimation and tractography in diffusion MRI: development of simulated brain images and comparison of multi-fiber analysis methods at clinical b-values.,"Advances in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) have led to many alternative diffusion sampling strategies and analysis methodologies. A common objective among methods is estimation of white matter fiber orientations within each voxel, as doing so permits in-vivo fiber-tracking and the ability to study brain connectivity and networks. Knowledge of how DW-MRI sampling schemes affect fiber estimation accuracy, tractography and the ability to recover complex white-matter pathways, differences between results due to choice of analysis method, and which method(s) perform optimally for specific data sets, all remain important problems, especially as tractography-based studies become common. In this work, we begin to address these concerns by developing sets of simulated diffusion-weighted brain images which we then use to quantitatively evaluate the performance of six DW-MRI analysis methods in terms of estimated fiber orientation accuracy, false-positive (spurious) and false-negative (missing) fiber rates, and fiber-tracking. The analysis methods studied are: 1) a two-compartment """"ball and stick"""" model (BSM) (Behrens et al., 2003); 2) a non-negativity constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) approach (Tournier et al., 2007); 3) analytical q-ball imaging (QBI) (Descoteaux et al., 2007); 4) q-ball imaging with Funk-Radon and Cosine Transform (FRACT) (Haldar and Leahy, 2013); 5) q-ball imaging within constant solid angle (CSA) (Aganj et al., 2010); and 6) a generalized Fourier transform approach known as generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) (Yeh et al., 2010). We investigate these methods using 20, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 evenly distributed q-space samples of a single shell, and focus on a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 18) and diffusion-weighting (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) common to clinical studies. We found that the BSM and CSD methods consistently yielded the least fiber orientation error and simultaneously greatest detection rate of fibers. Fiber detection rate was found to be the most distinguishing characteristic between the methods, and a significant factor for complete recovery of tractography through complex white-matter pathways. For example, while all methods recovered similar tractography of prominent white matter pathways of limited fiber crossing, CSD (which had the highest fiber detection rate, especially for voxels containing three fibers) recovered the greatest number of fibers and largest fraction of correct tractography for complex three-fiber crossing regions. The synthetic data sets, ground-truth, and tools for quantitative evaluation are publically available on the NITRC website as the project """"Simulated DW-MRI Brain Data Sets for Quantitative Evaluation of Estimated Fiber Orientations"""" at http://www.nitrc.org/projects/sim_dwi_brain.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data deposited as referenced
25561511,Genomic classifier ColoPrint predicts recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer patients more accurately than clinical factors.,"<h4>Background</h4>Approximately 20% of patients with stage II colorectal cancer will experience a relapse. Current clinical-pathologic stratification factors do not allow clear identification of these high-risk patients. ColoPrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, http://www.agendia.com) is a gene expression classifier that distinguishes patients with low or high risk of disease relapse.<h4>Methods</h4>ColoPrint was developed using whole-genome expression data and validated in several independent validation cohorts. Stage II patients from these studies were pooled (n = 416), and ColoPrint was compared with clinical risk factors described in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2013 Guidelines for Colon Cancer. Median follow-up was 81 months. Most patients (70%) did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Risk of relapse (ROR) was defined as survival until first event of recurrence or death from cancer.<h4>Results</h4>In the pooled stage II data set, ColoPrint identified 63% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 10%, whereas high-risk patients (37%) had a 5-year ROR of 21%, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.16 (p = .004). This remained significant in a multivariate model that included number of lymph nodes retrieved and microsatellite instability. In the T3 microsatellite-stable subgroup (n = 301), ColoPrint classified 59% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 9.9%. High-risk patients (31%) had a 22.4% ROR (HR: 2.41; p = .005). In contrast, the NCCN clinical high-risk factors were unable to distinguish high- and low-risk patients (15% vs. 13% ROR; p = .55).<h4>Conclusion</h4>ColoPrint significantly improved prognostic accuracy independent of microsatellite status or clinical variables, facilitating the identification of patients at higher risk who might be considered for additional treatment.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Factor graphs, probabilistic graphical models, are used to properly account for cell lineage and cell phenotype information. Our model is applied to time-lapse movies of murine granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) cells. It decides between competing hypotheses on the mechanisms of their differentiation.

Scientists need access to the figures and the knowledge they represent in order to validate research findings and to generate new hypotheses. By themselves, these figures are nearly always incomprehensible to both humans and machines and their associated texts are therefore essential for full comprehension. The associated text of a figure, however, is scattered throughout its full-text article and contains redundant information content. In this paper, we report the continued development and evaluation of several figure summarization systems, the FigSum+ systems, that automatically identify associated texts, remove redundant information, and generate a text summary for every figure in an article. Using a set of 94 annotated figures selected from 19 different journals, we conducted an intrinsic evaluation of FigSum+. We evaluate the performance by precision, recall, F1, and ROUGE scores. The best FigSum+ system is based on an unsupervised method, achieving F1 score of 0.66 and ROUGE-1 score of 0.97.

25687422,Mega2: validated data-reformatting for linkage and association analyses.,"BACKGROUND:In a typical study of the genetics of a complex human disease, many different analysis programs are used, to test for linkage and association. This requires extensive and careful data reformatting, as many of these analysis programs use differing input formats. Writing scripts to facilitate this can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address these issues, the open source Mega2 data reformatting program provides validated and tested data conversions from several commonly-used input formats to many output formats. RESULTS:Mega2, the Manipulation Environment for Genetic Analysis, facilitates the creation of analysis-ready datasets from data gathered as part of a genetic study. It transparently allows users to process genetic data for family-based or case/control studies accurately and efficiently. In addition to data validation checks, Mega2 provides analysis setup capabilities for a broad choice of commonly-used genetic analysis programs. First released in 2000, Mega2 has recently been significantly improved in a number of ways. We have rewritten it in C++ and have reduced its memory requirements. Mega2 now can read input files in LINKAGE, PLINK, and VCF/BCF formats, as well as its own specialized annotated format. It supports conversion to many commonly-used formats including SOLAR, PLINK, Merlin, Mendel, SimWalk2, Cranefoot, IQLS, FBAT, MORGAN, BEAGLE, Eigenstrat, Structure, and PLINK/SEQ. When controlled by a batch file, Mega2 can be used non-interactively in data reformatting pipelines. Support for genetic data from several other species besides humans has been added. CONCLUSIONS:By providing tested and validated data reformatting, Mega2 facilitates more accurate and extensive analyses of genetic data, avoiding the need to write, debug, and maintain one's own custom data reformatting scripts.

25725090,SimSeq: a nonparametric approach to simulation of RNA-sequence datasets.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>RNA sequencing analysis methods are often derived by relying on hypothetical parametric models for read counts that are not likely to be precisely satisfied in practice. Methods are often tested by analyzing data that have been simulated according to the assumed model. This testing strategy can result in an overly optimistic view of the performance of an RNA-seq analysis method.<h4>Results</h4>We develop a data-based simulation algorithm for RNA-seq data. The vector of read counts simulated for a given experimental unit has a joint distribution that closely matches the distribution of a source RNA-seq dataset provided by the user. We conduct simulation experiments based on the negative binomial distribution and our proposed nonparametric simulation algorithm. We compare performance between the two simulation experiments over a small subset of statistical methods for RNA-seq analysis available in the literature. We use as a benchmark the ability of a method to control the false discovery rate. Not surprisingly, methods based on parametric modeling assumptions seem to perform better with respect to false discovery rate control when data are simulated from parametric models rather than using our more realistic nonparametric simulation strategy.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The nonparametric simulation algorithm developed in this article is implemented in the R package SimSeq, which is freely available under the GNU General Public License (version 2 or later) from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.rproject.org/).<h4>Contact</h4>sgbenidt@gmail.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25725497,IVA: accurate de novo assembly of RNA virus genomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>An accurate genome assembly from short read sequencing data is critical for downstream analysis, for example allowing investigation of variants within a sequenced population. However, assembling sequencing data from virus samples, especially RNA viruses, into a genome sequence is challenging due to the combination of viral population diversity and extremely uneven read depth caused by amplification bias in the inevitable reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification process of current methods.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a new de novo assembler called IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler) designed specifically for read pairs sequenced at highly variable depth from RNA virus samples. We tested IVA on datasets from 140 sequenced samples from human immunodeficiency virus-1 or influenza-virus-infected people and demonstrated that IVA outperforms all other virus de novo assemblers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software runs under Linux, has the GPLv3 licence and is freely available from http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/iva","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25765651,Analysis of strand-specific RNA-seq data using machine learning reveals the structures of transcription units in Clostridium thermocellum.,"Identification of transcription units (TUs) encoded in a bacterial genome is essential to elucidation of transcriptional regulation of the organism. To gain a detailed understanding of the dynamically composed TU structures, we have used four strand-specific RNA-seq (ssRNA-seq) datasets collected under two experimental conditions to derive the genomic TU organization of Clostridium thermocellum using a machine-learning approach. Our method accurately predicted the genomic boundaries of individual TUs based on two sets of parameters measuring the RNA-seq expression patterns across the genome: expression-level continuity and variance. A total of 2590 distinct TUs are predicted based on the four RNA-seq datasets. Among the predicted TUs, 44% have multiple genes. We assessed our prediction method on an independent set of RNA-seq data with longer reads. The evaluation confirmed the high quality of the predicted TUs. Functional enrichment analyses on a selected subset of the predicted TUs revealed interesting biology. To demonstrate the generality of the prediction method, we have also applied the method to RNA-seq data collected on Escherichia coli and achieved high prediction accuracies. The TU prediction program named SeqTU is publicly available at https://code.google.com/p/seqtu/. We expect that the predicted TUs can serve as the baseline information for studying transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in C. thermocellum and other bacteria.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The co-expression patterns of DSCR genes in brain were calculated by using multivariate statistical methods.<h4>Results</h4>Highest levels of gene expression were registered at caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens and putamen among central areas of cerebral cortex. Increased expression levels of RCAN1 that encode by a protein involved in signal transduction process of the CNS were recorded for PCP4 that participates in the binding to calmodulin and TTC3; a protein that is associated with differentiation of neurons. That previously identified brain structures play a crucial role in the learning process, in different class of memory and in motor skills.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The precise regulation of DSCR gene expression is crucial to maintain the brain homeostasis, especially in those areas with high levels of gene expression associated with a remarkable process of learning and cognition.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not about the resource

25833981,Community-based management of severe acute malnutrition in India: new evidence from Bihar.,"<h4>Background</h4>An estimated one-third of the world's children who are wasted live in India. In Bihar state, of children <5 y old, 27.1% are wasted and 8.3% have severe acute malnutrition (SAM). In 2009, Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) initiated a community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) program for children aged 6-59 mo with SAM.<h4>Objective</h4>In this report, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of 8274 children treated between February 2009 and September 2011.<h4>Design</h4>Between February 2009 and June 2010, the program admitted children with a weight-for-height z score (WHZ) <-3 SD and/or midupper arm circumference (MUAC) <110 mm and discharged those who reached a WHZ >-2 SDs and MUAC >110 mm. These variables changed in July 2010 to admission on the basis of an MUAC <115 mm and discharge at an MUAC =120 mm. Uncomplicated SAM cases were treated as outpatients in the community by using a WHO-standard, ready-to-use, therapeutic lipid-based paste produced in India; complicated cases were treated as inpatients by using F75/F100 WHO-standard milk until they could complete treatment in the community.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 8274 children were admitted including 5149 girls (62.2%), 6613 children aged 6-23 mo (79.9%), and 87.3% children who belonged to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, or Other Backward Caste families or households. Of 3873 children admitted under the old criteria, 41 children (1.1%) died, 2069 children (53.4%) were discharged as cured, and 1485 children (38.3%) defaulted. Of 4401 children admitted under the new criteria, 36 children (0.8%) died, 2526 children (57.4%) were discharged as cured, and 1591 children (36.2%) defaulted. For children discharged as cured, the mean (SD) weight gain and length of stay were 4.7  3.1 and 5.1  3.7 g  kg(-1)  d(-1) and 8.7  6.1 and 7.3  5.6 wk under the old and new criteria, respectively (P < 0.01). After adjustment, significant risk factors for default were as follows: no community referral for admission, more severe wasting on admission, younger age, and a long commute for treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To our knowledge, this is the first conventional CMAM program in India and has achieved low mortality and high cure rates in nondefaulting children. The new admission criteria lower the threshold for severity with the result that more children are included who are at lower risk of death and have a smaller WHZ deficit to correct than do children identified by the old criteria.

25837579,Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenetic Inference with Selection on Protein Folding Stability.,"Despite intense work, incorporating constraints on protein native structures into the mathematical models of molecular evolution remains difficult, because most models and programs assume that protein sites evolve independently, whereas protein stability is maintained by interactions between sites. Here, we address this problem by developing a new mean-field substitution model that generates independent site-specific amino acid distributions with constraints on the stability of the native state against both unfolding and misfolding. The model depends on a background distribution of amino acids and one selection parameter that we fix maximizing the likelihood of the observed protein sequence. The analytic solution of the model shows that the main determinant of the site-specific distributions is the number of native contacts of the site and that the most variable sites are those with an intermediate number of native contacts. The mean-field models obtained, taking into account misfolded conformations, yield larger likelihood than models that only consider the native state, because their average hydrophobicity is more realistic, and they produce on the average stable sequences for most proteins. We evaluated the mean-field model with respect to empirical substitution models on 12 test data sets of different protein families. In all cases, the observed site-specific sequence profiles presented smaller Kullback-Leibler divergence from the mean-field distributions than from the empirical substitution model. Next, we obtained substitution rates combining the mean-field frequencies with an empirical substitution model. The resulting mean-field substitution model assigns larger likelihood than the empirical model to all studied families when we consider sequences with identity larger than 0.35, plausibly a condition that enforces conservation of the native structure across the family. We found that the mean-field model performs better than other structurally constrained models with similar or higher complexity. With respect to the much more complex model recently developed by Bordner and Mittelmann, which takes into account pairwise terms in the amino acid distributions and also optimizes the exchangeability matrix, our model performed worse for data with small sequence divergence but better for data with larger sequence divergence. The mean-field model has been implemented into the computer program Prot_Evol that is freely available at http://ub.cbm.uam.es/software/Prot_Evol.php.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25840970,Global Transcriptional Changes Following Statin Treatment in Breast Cancer.,"<h4>Background</h4>Statins purportedly exert antitumoral effects, but the underlying mechanisms are currently not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore potential statin-induced effects on global gene expression profiles in primary breast cancer.<h4>Experimental design</h4>This window-of-opportunity phase II trial enrolled 50 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients prescribed atorvastatin (80 mg/day) for 2 weeks presurgically. Pre- and posttreatment tumor samples were analyzed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) to identify differentially expressed genes. Similarly, SAM and gene ontology analyses were applied to gene expression data derived from atorvastatin-treated breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, BT474, SKBR3, and MDAMB231) comparing treated and untreated cells. The Systematic Motif Analysis Retrieval Tool (SMART) was used to identify enriched transcription factor-binding sites. Literature Vector Analysis (LitVAn) identified gene module functionality, and pathway analysis was performed using GeneGo Pathways Software (MetaCore; https://portal.genego.com/).<h4>Results</h4>Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in paired clinical samples revealed 407 significantly differentially expressed genes (FDR = 0); 32 upregulated and 375 downregulated genes. Restricted filtration (fold change =1.49) resulted in 21 upregulated and 46 downregulated genes. Significantly upregulated genes included DUSP1, RHOB1, GADD45B, and RGS1. Pooled results from gene ontology, LitVAn and SMART analyses identified statin-induced effects on the apoptotic and MAPK pathways among others. Comparative analyses of gene expression profiles in breast cancer cell lines showed significant upregulation of the mevalonate and proapoptotic pathways following atorvastatin treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We report potential statin-induced changes in global tumor gene expression profiles, indicating MAPK pathway inhibition and proapoptotic events.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource
25855375,Alterations of Functional Connectivity Among Resting-State Networks in Hypothyroidism.,"Hypothyroidism affects brain functioning as suggested by various neuroimaging studies. The primary focus of the present study was to examine whether hypothyroidism would impact connectivity among resting-state networks (RSNs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Twenty-two patients with hypothyroidism and 22 healthy controls were recruited and scanned using rsfMRI. The data were analysed using independent component analysis and a dual regression approach that was applied on five RSNs that were identified using fsl software (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Hypothyroid patients showed significantly decreased functional connectivity in the regions of the right frontoparietal network (frontal pole), the medial visual network (lateral occipital gyrus, precuneus cortex and cuneus) and the motor network (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, precuneus cortex, paracingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus and supramarginal gyrus) compared to healthy controls. The reduced functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, the medial visual network and the motor network suggests neurocognitive alterations in hypothyroid patients in the corresponding functions. However, the study would be further continued to investigate the effects of thyroxine treatment and correlation with neurocognitive scores. The findings of the present study provide further interesting insights into our understanding of the action of thyroid hormone on the adult human brain.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25855811,SANSparallel: interactive homology search against Uniprot.,"Proteins evolve by mutations and natural selection. The network of sequence similarities is a rich source for mining homologous relationships that inform on protein structure and function. There are many servers available to browse the network of homology relationships but one has to wait up to a minute for results. The SANSparallel webserver provides protein sequence database searches with immediate response and professional alignment visualization by third-party software. The output is a list, pairwise alignment or stacked alignment of sequence-similar proteins from Uniprot, UniRef90/50, Swissprot or Protein Data Bank. The stacked alignments are viewed in Jalview or as sequence logos. The database search uses the suffix array neighborhood search (SANS) method, which has been re-implemented as a client-server, improved and parallelized. The method is extremely fast and as sensitive as BLAST above 50% sequence identity. Benchmarks show that the method is highly competitive compared to previously published fast database search programs: UBLAST, DIAMOND, LAST, LAMBDA, RAPSEARCH2 and BLAT. The web server can be accessed interactively or programmatically at http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/cgi-bin/sans/sans.cgi. It can be used to make protein functional annotation pipelines more efficient, and it is useful in interactive exploration of the detailed evidence supporting the annotation of particular proteins of interest.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25861968,MetaSV: an accurate and integrative structural-variant caller for next generation sequencing.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Structural variations (SVs) are large genomic rearrangements that vary significantly in size, making them challenging to detect with the relatively short reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS). Different SV detection methods have been developed; however, each is limited to specific kinds of SVs with varying accuracy and resolution. Previous works have attempted to combine different methods, but they still suffer from poor accuracy particularly for insertions. We propose MetaSV, an integrated SV caller which leverages multiple orthogonal SV signals for high accuracy and resolution. MetaSV proceeds by merging SVs from multiple tools for all types of SVs. It also analyzes soft-clipped reads from alignment to detect insertions accurately since existing tools underestimate insertion SVs. Local assembly in combination with dynamic programming is used to improve breakpoint resolution. Paired-end and coverage information is used to predict SV genotypes. Using simulation and experimental data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaSV across various SV types and sizes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Code in Python is at http://bioinform.github.io/metasv/.<h4>Contact</h4>rd@bina.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The specimens were radiographed using a charge-coupled device sensor along with an 11-step aluminum step wedge (1.5-mm incremental steps) and 1-mm-thick tooth cut using five tube voltage/exposure time setups (60 kVp, 0.10/0.08 seconds; 70 kVp, 0.10/0.08/0.06 seconds) at 4 mA and 30 cm. The radiopacity of the specimens was compared with that of the aluminum step wedge and human enamel and dentin using NIH ImageJ software (available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). A linear regression model for the aluminum step wedge was constructed, and the data were analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan post hoc test.<h4>Results</h4>Maxcem Elite (5.142 to 5.441) showed the highest radiopacity of all materials, followed in order by Multilink Speed (3.731 to 3.396) and V-link (2.763 to 3.103). The radiopacity of Panavia F 2.0 (2.025 to 2.429), BisCem (1.825 to 2.218), Clearfil SA Luting (1.692 to 2.145), Duolink (1.707 to 1.993), and RelyX Unicem Clicker (1.586 to 1.979) were between enamel (2.117 to 2.330) and dentin (1.302 to 1.685). The radiopacity of 70 kVp conditions was higher than that of the 60 kVp conditions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The radiopacities of the tested luting materials were greater than those of dentin or aluminum, satisfying the criteria of the International Organization for Standardization, and they differed significantly from each other in the exposure setups.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25871442,Monitoring matrix metalloproteinase activity at the epidermal-dermal interface by SILAC-iTRAQ-TAILS.,"Secreted proteases act on interstitial tissue secretomes released from multiple cell types. Thus, substrate proteins might be part of higher molecular complexes constituted by many proteins with diverse and potentially unknown cellular origin. In cell culture, these may be reconstituted by mixing native secretomes from different cell types prior to incubation with a test protease. Although current degradomics techniques could identify novel substrate proteins in these complexes, all information on the cellular origin is lost. To address this limitation, we combined iTRAQ-based terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (iTRAQ-TAILS) with SILAC to assign proteins to a specific cell type by MS1- and their cleavage by MS2-based quantification in the same experiment. We demonstrate the power of our newly established workflow by monitoring matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 10 dependent cleavages in mixtures from light-labeled keratinocyte and heavy-labeled fibroblast secretomes. This analysis correctly assigned extracellular matrix components, such as laminins and collagens, to their respective cellular origins and revealed their processing in an MMP10-dependent manner. Hence, our newly devised degradomics workflow facilitates deeper insight into protease activity in complex intercellular compartments such as the epidermal-dermal interface by integrating multiple modes of quantification with positional proteomics.

25882789,ReMo-SNPs: a new software tool for identification of polymorphisms in regions and motifs genome-wide.,"Studies of complex genetic diseases have revealed many risk factors of small effect, but the combined amount of heritability explained is still low. Genome-wide association studies are often underpowered to identify true effects because of the very large number of parallel tests. There is, therefore, a great need to generate data sets that are enriched for those markers that have an increased a priori chance of being functional, such as markers in genomic regions involved in gene regulation. ReMo-SNPs is a computational program developed to aid researchers in the process of selecting functional SNPs for association analyses in user-specified regions and/or motifs genome-wide. The useful feature of automatic selection of genotyped markers in the user-provided material makes the output data ready to be used in a following association study. In this article we describe the program and its functions. We also validate the program by including an example study on three different transcription factors and results from an association study on two psychiatric phenotypes. The flexibility of the ReMo-SNPs program enables the user to study any region or sequence of interest, without limitation to transcription factor binding regions and motifs.

25886978,Accurate prediction of RNA nucleotide interactions with backbone k-tree model.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Given the importance of non-coding RNAs to cellular regulatory functions, it would be highly desirable to have accurate computational prediction of RNA 3D structure, a task which remains challenging. Even for a short RNA sequence, the space of tertiary conformations is immense; existing methods to identify native-like conformations mostly resort to random sampling of conformations to achieve computational feasibility. However, native conformations may not be examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised due to sampling. State-of-the-art methods have yet to deliver satisfactory predictions for RNAs of length beyond 50 nucleotides.<h4>Results</h4>This paper presents a method to tackle a key step in the RNA 3D structure prediction problem, the prediction of the nucleotide interactions that constitute the desired 3D structure. The research is based on a novel graph model, called a backbone k-tree, to tightly constrain the nucleotide interaction relationships considered for RNA 3D structures. It is shown that the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of nucleotide interactions (including the non-canonical interactions in all recently revealed families) from the query sequence along with known or predicted canonical basepairs. The preliminary results indicate that in most cases the new method can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that constitute the 3D structure of the query sequence. It thus provides a useful tool for the accurate prediction of RNA 3D structure.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The source package for BkTree is available at http://rna-informatics.uga.edu/index.php?f=software&p=BkTree.<h4>Contact</h4>lding@uga.edu or cai@cs.uga.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
25887233,Kernel approaches for differential expression analysis of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Data generated from metabolomics experiments are different from other types of """"-omics"""" data. For example, a common phenomenon in mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics data is that the data matrix frequently contains missing values, which complicates some quantitative analyses. One way to tackle this problem is to treat them as absent. Hence there are two types of information that are available in metabolomics data: presence/absence of a metabolite and a quantitative value of the abundance level of a metabolite if it is present. Combining these two layers of information poses challenges to the application of traditional statistical approaches in differential expression analysis.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we propose a novel kernel-based score test for the metabolomics differential expression analysis. In order to simultaneously capture both the continuous pattern and discrete pattern in metabolomics data, two new kinds of kernels are designed. One is the distance-based kernel and the other is the stratified kernel. While we initially describe the procedures in the case of single-metabolite analysis, we extend the methods to handle metabolite sets as well.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Evaluation based on both simulated data and real data from a liver cancer metabolomics study indicates that our kernel method has a better performance than some existing alternatives.

25952609,Heterozygous genome assembly via binary classification of homologous sequence.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genome assemblers to date have predominantly targeted haploid reference reconstruction from homozygous data. When applied to diploid genome assembly, these assemblers perform poorly, owing to the violation of assumptions during both the contigging and scaffolding phases. Effective tools to overcome these problems are in growing demand. Increasing parameter stringency during contigging is an effective solution to obtaining haplotype-specific contigs; however, effective algorithms for scaffolding such contigs are lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We present a stand-alone scaffolding algorithm, ScaffoldScaffolder, designed specifically for scaffolding diploid genomes. The algorithm identifies homologous sequences as found in """"bubble"""" structures in scaffold graphs. Machine learning classification is used to then classify sequences in partial bubbles as homologous or non-homologous sequences prior to reconstructing haplotype-specific scaffolds. We define four new metrics for assessing diploid scaffolding accuracy: contig sequencing depth, contig homogeneity, phase group homogeneity, and heterogeneity between phase groups.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate the viability of using bubbles to identify heterozygous homologous contigs, which we term homolotigs. We show that machine learning classification trained on these homolotig pairs can be used effectively for identifying homologous sequences elsewhere in the data with high precision (assuming error-free reads).<h4>Conclusion</h4>More work is required to comparatively analyze this approach on real data with various parameters and classifiers against other diploid genome assembly methods. However, the initial results of ScaffoldScaffolder supply validity to the idea of employing machine learning in the difficult task of diploid genome assembly.

Collaboration with environmental health science through team projects has advanced and improved our understanding of environmental health and justice.<h4>Objective</h4>We sought to identify diverse methods and topics in which social scientists have expanded environmental health understandings at multiple levels, to examine how transdisciplinary environmental health research fosters better science, and to learn how these partnerships have been able to flourish because of the support from National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed various types of social science research to investigate how social science contributes to environmental health. We also examined NIEHS programs that foster social science. In addition, we developed a case study of a community-based participation research project in Akwesasne in order to demonstrate how social science has enhanced environmental health science.<h4>Results</h4>Social science has informed environmental health science through ethnographic studies of contaminated communities, analysis of spatial distribution of environmental injustice, psychological experience of contamination, social construction of risk and risk perception, and social impacts of disasters. Social science-environmental health team science has altered the way scientists traditionally explore exposure by pressing for cumulative exposure approaches and providing research data for policy applications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A transdisciplinary approach for environmental health practice has emerged that engages the social sciences to paint a full picture of the consequences of contamination so that policy makers, regulators, public health officials, and other stakeholders can better ameliorate impacts and prevent future exposure.<h4>Citation</h4>Hoover E, Renauld M, Edelstein MR, Brown P. 2015.

25987413,A Scalable Approach for Protein False Discovery Rate Estimation in Large Proteomic Data Sets.,"Calculating the number of confidently identified proteins and estimating false discovery rate (FDR) is a challenge when analyzing very large proteomic data sets such as entire human proteomes. Biological and technical heterogeneity in proteomic experiments further add to the challenge and there are strong differences in opinion regarding the conceptual validity of a protein FDR and no consensus regarding the methodology for protein FDR determination. There are also limitations inherent to the widely used classic target-decoy strategy that particularly show when analyzing very large data sets and that lead to a strong over-representation of decoy identifications. In this study, we investigated the merits of the classic, as well as a novel target-decoy-based protein FDR estimation approach, taking advantage of a heterogeneous data collection comprised of ~19,000 LC-MS/MS runs deposited in ProteomicsDB (https://www.proteomicsdb.org). The """"picked"""" protein FDR approach treats target and decoy sequences of the same protein as a pair rather than as individual entities and chooses either the target or the decoy sequence depending on which receives the highest score. We investigated the performance of this approach in combination with q-value based peptide scoring to normalize sample-, instrument-, and search engine-specific differences. The """"picked"""" target-decoy strategy performed best when protein scoring was based on the best peptide q-value for each protein yielding a stable number of true positive protein identifications over a wide range of q-value thresholds. We show that this simple and unbiased strategy eliminates a conceptual issue in the commonly used """"classic"""" protein FDR approach that causes overprediction of false-positive protein identification in large data sets. The approach scales from small to very large data sets without losing performance, consistently increases the number of true-positive protein identifications and is readily implemented in proteomics analysis software.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

26051252,Light-weight reference-based compression of FASTQ data.,"<h4>Background</h4>The exponential growth of next generation sequencing (NGS) data has posed big challenges to data storage, management and archive. Data compression is one of the effective solutions, where reference-based compression strategies can typically achieve superior compression ratios compared to the ones not relying on any reference.<h4>Results</h4>This paper presents a lossless light-weight reference-based compression algorithm namely LW-FQZip to compress FASTQ data. The three components of any given input, i.e., metadata, short reads and quality score strings, are first parsed into three data streams in which the redundancy information are identified and eliminated independently. Particularly, well-designed incremental and run-length-limited encoding schemes are utilized to compress the metadata and quality score streams, respectively. To handle the short reads, LW-FQZip uses a novel light-weight mapping model to fast map them against external reference sequence(s) and produce concise alignment results for storage. The three processed data streams are then packed together with some general purpose compression algorithms like LZMA. LW-FQZip was evaluated on eight real-world NGS data sets and achieved compression ratios in the range of 0.111-0.201. This is comparable or superior to other state-of-the-art lossless NGS data compression algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LW-FQZip is a program that enables efficient lossless FASTQ data compression. It contributes to the state of art applications for NGS data storage and transmission. LW-FQZip is freely available online at: http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/zhuzx/LWFQZip.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26063840,EXIMS: an improved data analysis pipeline based on a new peak picking method for EXploring Imaging Mass Spectrometry data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) in 'omics' data acquisition generates detailed information about the spatial distribution of molecules in a given biological sample. Various data processing methods have been developed for exploring the resultant high volume data. However, most of these methods process data in the spectral domain and do not make the most of the important spatial information available through this technology. Therefore, we propose a novel streamlined data analysis pipeline specifically developed for MALDI-IMS data utilizing significant spatial information for identifying hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in these complex datasets.<h4>Methods</h4>The proposed unsupervised algorithm uses Sliding Window Normalization (SWN) and a new spatial distribution based peak picking method developed based on Gray level Co-Occurrence (GCO) matrices followed by clustering of biomolecules. We also use gist descriptors and an improved version of GCO matrices to extract features from molecular images and minimum medoid distance to automatically estimate the number of possible groups.<h4>Results</h4>We evaluated our algorithm using a new MALDI-IMS metabolomics dataset of a plant (Eucalypt) leaf. The algorithm revealed hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in the dataset, which the current Component Analysis and Segmentation Map based approaches failed to extract. We further demonstrate the performance of our peak picking method over other traditional approaches by using a publicly available MALDI-IMS proteomics dataset of a rat brain. Although SWN did not show any significant improvement as compared with using no normalization, the visual assessment showed an improvement as compared to using the median normalization.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The source code and sample data are freely available at http://exims.sourceforge.net/.<h4>Contact</h4>awgcdw@student.unimelb.edu.au or chalini_w@live.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26072509,IgRepertoireConstructor: a novel algorithm for antibody repertoire construction and immunoproteogenomics analysis.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>The analysis of concentrations of circulating antibodies in serum (antibody repertoire) is a fundamental, yet poorly studied, problem in immunoinformatics. The two current approaches to the analysis of antibody repertoires [next generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry (MS)] present difficult computational challenges since antibodies are not directly encoded in the germline but are extensively diversified by somatic recombination and hypermutations. Therefore, the protein database required for the interpretation of spectra from circulating antibodies is custom for each individual. Although such a database can be constructed via NGS, the reads generated by NGS are error-prone and even a single nucleotide error precludes identification of a peptide by the standard proteomics tools. Here, we present the IgRepertoireConstructor algorithm that performs error-correction of immunosequencing reads and uses mass spectra to validate the constructed antibody repertoires.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>IgRepertoireConstructor is open source and freely available as a C++ and Python program running on all Unix-compatible platforms.

We derive a combinatorial characterization of the solutions to this problem and show that the problem is NP-complete. We derive an integer linear programming solution to the VAF factorization problem in the case of error-free data and extend this solution to real data with a probabilistic model for errors. The resulting AncesTree algorithm is better able to identify ancestral relationships between individual mutations than existing approaches, particularly in ultra-deep sequencing data when high read counts for mutations yield high confidence VAFs.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>An implementation of AncesTree is available at: http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/software.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26072515,Inferring orthologous gene regulatory networks using interspecies data fusion.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The ability to jointly learn gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in, or leverage GRNs between related species would allow the vast amount of legacy data obtained in model organisms to inform the GRNs of more complex, or economically or medically relevant counterparts. Examples include transferring information from Arabidopsis thaliana into related crop species for food security purposes, or from mice into humans for medical applications. Here we develop two related Bayesian approaches to network inference that allow GRNs to be jointly inferred in, or leveraged between, several related species: in one framework, network information is directly propagated between species; in the second hierarchical approach, network information is propagated via an unobserved 'hypernetwork'. In both frameworks, information about network similarity is captured via graph kernels, with the networks additionally informed by species-specific time series gene expression data, when available, using Gaussian processes to model the dynamics of gene expression.<h4>Results</h4>Results on in silico benchmarks demonstrate that joint inference, and leveraging of known networks between species, offers better accuracy than standalone inference. The direct propagation of network information via the non-hierarchical framework is more appropriate when there are relatively few species, while the hierarchical approach is better suited when there are many species. Both methods are robust to small amounts of mislabelling of orthologues. Finally, the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae data and networks to inform inference of networks in the budding yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe predicts a novel role in cell cycle regulation for Gas1 (SPAC19B12.02c), a 1,3-beta-glucanosyltransferase.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MATLAB code is available from http://go.warwick.ac.uk/systemsbiology/software/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26078289,"Breast Cancer and Occupation: The Need for Action: APHA Policy Statement Number 20146, Issued November 18, 2014.","Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women in the United States and other countries, making it a major public health concern. Despite significant scientific evidence about its known or suspected causes, research and prevention measures to identify and eliminate occupational and other environmental hazards and risk factors for breast cancer remain largely overlooked. As a result, hazards continue unabated for women generally, especially those who work outside the home. The science linking breast cancer and occupation in particular is growing. Researchers have identified commonly used chemicals that induce breast tumors in test animals. Animal studies link chemicals that mimic reproductive hormones to elevated breast cancer rates. Other animal and human studies link chemical exposures to increased breast cancer rates, including two recent investigations focused on occupational hazards. But the latter are the exception. Studies that attempt to identify and characterize workplace agents linked to breast cancer, as well as intervention studies focusing on the use of less toxic processes and substances, are limited. In what might be construed as a case of gender and social class bias, many research and funding agencies have ignored or downplayed the role of occupational studies despite their relevance to prevention efforts. Action required starts with making a national priority of promoting and supporting research on occupational and other environmental causes of breast cancer. Other public health actions include hazard surveillance and primary prevention activities such as reductions in the use of toxic materials, informed substitution, and green chemistry efforts.

This article about deployed women veterans examines their specific health differences (e.g., research literature, post-traumatic stress disorder, and military sexual trauma), difficulties (e.g., reproductive, gynecologic, urinary, suicide), and gender disparities (varied treatment patterns).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Understanding these gender situations, civilian nurses can better advocate with increasing evidence-based decisions that their physical and behavioral responses were different from their male counterparts. Continual assessment, knowledgeable care, ongoing literature review, interdisciplinary health team development, and the presence of resourceful community agencies should be a significant part of their holistic care.

26106259,MITOSCISSOR: A Useful Tool for Auto-Assembly of Mitogenomic Datasets in the Evolutionary Analysis of Fishes.,"As a result of the development of rapid and efficient sequencing technologies, complete sequences of numerous mitochondrial genomes are now available. Mitochondrial genomes have been widely used to evaluate relationships between species in several fields, including evolutionary and population genetics, as well as in forensic identification and in the study of mitochondrial diseases in humans. However, the creation of mitochondrial genomes is extremely time consuming. In this paper, we present a new tool, MITOSCISSOR, which is a rapid method for parsing and formatting dozens of complete mitochondrial genome sequences. With the aid of MITOSCISSOR, complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 103 species from Tetraodontiformes (a difficult-to-classify order of fish) were easily parsed and formatted. It typically takes several days to produce similar results when relying upon manual editing. This tool could open the .gb file of Genbank directly and help us to use existing mitogenomic data. In the present study, we established the first clear and robust molecular phylogeny of 103 tetraodontiform fishes, a goal that has long eluded ichthyologists. MITOSCISSOR greatly increases the efficiency with which DNA data files can be parsed and annotated, and thus has the potential to greatly facilitate evolutionary analysis using mitogenomic data.

26115255,Estimation of the environmental dam-offspring correlation in beef cattle.,"A long standing controversy in animal breeding is related to the strong negative estimates of the direct-maternal genetic correlation obtained when fitting data on maternally influenced traits. In this article, we focused on a model that introduces a new correlation parameter among dam-offspring records. The extant theory allows estimation of the parameter when dams have at most a single offspring. Our goal was to develop an inferential procedure in a more general setting. To do so, we applied a Bayesian approach and we showed that the estimation could be accomplished by introducing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) step embedded into a regular Gibbs sampler program. The procedure was implemented by means of an MCMC algorithm known as the Griddy-Gibbs sampler, and a Fortran 90 library was created to accomplish the task. The computer program is available from http://www.agro.uba.ar/catedras/mg_animal/software/RDBLK. With this tool at hand, we applied the inferential procedure to weaning weight records on beef cattle calves from an Argentinean Hereford herd, and we estimated the marginal distribution of the environmental dam-offspring correlation parameter. The distribution was unimodal and symmetric with a mean value of -0.14 (0.03) and a 95% high posterior density interval between -0.20 and -0.07, indicating that the model placed a huge mass on negative values of the parameter. Noticeably, the magnitude of the direct-maternal genetic correlation diminished from -0.61 to -0.37 with respect to the standard maternal animal model. This result reinforces the idea that environmental covariances among dam-offspring records may bias the estimate of the direct-maternal genetic correlation.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

As quality assessment assumes prior knowledge on species phylogenies, we investigated the congruency between existing species trees by comparing the relationships of 147 QfO reference organisms from six Tree of Life (ToL)/species tree projects: The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy, Opentree of Life, the sequenced species/species ToL, the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) database, and trees published by Ciccarelli et al.

A nested phylogenetic reconstruction approach provides scalable resolution in the eukaryotic Tree Of Life. PeerJ PrePrints 2:223) Our study reveals that each species tree suggests a different phylogeny: 87 of the 146 (60%) possible splits of a dichotomous and rooted tree are congruent, while all other splits are incongruent in at least one of the species trees. Topological differences are observed not only at deep speciation events, but also within younger clades, such as Hominidae, Rodentia, Laurasiatheria, or rosids. The evolutionary relationships of 27 archaea and bacteria are highly inconsistent. By assessing 458,108 gene trees from 65 genomes, we show that consistent species topologies are more often supported by gene phylogenies than contradicting ones. The largest concordant species tree includes 77 of the QfO reference organisms at the most.

26150785,The PREP pipeline: standardized preprocessing for large-scale EEG analysis.,"The technology to collect brain imaging and physiological measures has become portable and ubiquitous, opening the possibility of large-scale analysis of real-world human imaging. By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed.

As proof of principle, we have populated the tool with Human Proteome Map (HPM) data. We were able to observe many biologically interesting features. From the vantage point of our chromosome 17 team, for example, we found more than 300 proteins from chromosome 17 expressed in each of the 30 tissues and cell types studied, with the highest number of expressed proteins being 685 in testis. Comparisons of expression levels across tissues showed low numbers of proteins expressed in esophagus, but esophagus had 12 cytoskeletal proteins coded on chromosome 17 with very high expression (>1000 spectral counts). This customized MI-PVT should be helpful for biologists to browse and study specific proteins and protein data sets across tissues and chromosomes. Users can upload any data of interest in MI-PVT for visualization.

26226130,Node sampling for protein complex estimation in bait-prey graphs.,"In cellular biology, node-and-edge graph or """"network"""" data collection often uses bait-prey technologies such as co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP). Bait-prey technologies assay relationships or """"interactions"""" between protein pairs, with CoIP specifically measuring protein complex co-membership. Analyses of CoIP data frequently focus on estimating protein complex membership. Due to budgetary and other constraints, exhaustive assay of the entire network using CoIP is not always possible. We describe a stratified sampling scheme to select baits for CoIP experiments when protein complex estimation is the main goal. Expanding upon the classic framework in which nodes represent proteins and edges represent pairwise interactions, we define generalized nodes as sets of adjacent nodes with identical adjacency outside the set and use these as strata from which to select the next set of baits. Strata are redefined at each round of sampling to incorporate accumulating data. This scheme maintains user-specified quality thresholds for protein complex estimates and, relative to simple random sampling, leads to a marked increase in the number of correctly estimated complexes at each round of sampling.

As data collection is increasingly streamlined and ubiquitous, data exploration, discovery and analytics get considerably harder. Exploratory querying of heterogeneous and multi-source information is both difficult and necessary to advance our knowledge about the world around us.<h4>Research design</h4>We developed a mechanism to integrate dispersed multi-source data and service the mashed information via human and machine interfaces in a secure, scalable manner. This process facilitates the exploration of subtle associations between variables, population strata, or clusters of data elements, which may be opaque to standard independent inspection of the individual sources. This a new platform includes a device agnostic tool (Dashboard webapp, http://socr.umich.edu/HTML5/Dashboard/) for graphical querying, navigating and exploring the multivariate associations in complex heterogeneous datasets.<h4>Results</h4>The paper illustrates this core functionality and serviceoriented infrastructure using healthcare data (e.g., US data from the 2010 Census, Demographic and Economic surveys, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Center for Medicare Services) as well as Parkinson's Disease neuroimaging data. Both the back-end data archive and the front-end dashboard interfaces are continuously expanded to include additional data elements and new ways to customize the human and machine interactions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A client-side data import utility allows for easy and intuitive integration of user-supplied datasets.

26241356,In the pursuit of a semantic similarity metric based on UMLS annotations for articles in PubMed Central Open Access.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Although full-text articles are provided by the publishers in electronic formats, it remains a challenge to find related work beyond the title and abstract context. Identifying related articles based on their abstract is indeed a good starting point; this process is straightforward and does not consume as many resources as full-text based similarity would require. However, further analyses may require in-depth understanding of the full content. Two articles with highly related abstracts can be substantially different regarding the full content. How similarity differs when considering title-and-abstract versus full-text and which semantic similarity metric provides better results when dealing with full-text articles are the main issues addressed in this manuscript.<h4>Methods</h4>We have benchmarked three similarity metrics - BM25, PMRA, and Cosine, in order to determine which one performs best when using concept-based annotations on full-text documents. We also evaluated variations in similarity values based on title-and-abstract against those relying on full-text. Our test dataset comprises the Genomics track article collection from the 2005 Text Retrieval Conference. Initially, we used an entity recognition software to semantically annotate titles and abstracts as well as full-text with concepts defined in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). For each article, we created a document profile, i.e., a set of identified concepts, term frequency, and inverse document frequency; we then applied various similarity metrics to those document profiles. We considered correlation, precision, recall, and F1 in order to determine which similarity metric performs best with concept-based annotations. For those full-text articles available in PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA), we also performed dispersion analyses in order to understand how similarity varies when considering full-text articles.<h4>Results</h4>We have found that the PubMed Related Articles similarity metric is the most suitable for full-text articles annotated with UMLS concepts. For similarity values above 0.8, all metrics exhibited an F1 around 0.2 and a recall around 0.1; BM25 showed the highest precision close to 1; in all cases the concept-based metrics performed better than the word-stem-based one. Our experiments show that similarity values vary when considering only title-and-abstract versus full-text similarity. Therefore, analyses based on full-text become useful when a given research requires going beyond title and abstract, particularly regarding connectivity across articles.<h4>Availability</h4>Visualization available at ljgarcia.github.io/semsim.benchmark/, data available at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13323.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data available at Zenodo

Currently, it is possible to visualize high-throughput data on top of pre-defined network layouts, but they are not always adapted to a given data analysis task. A network layout based simultaneously on the network structure and the associated multidimensional data might be advantageous for data visualization and analysis in some cases.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a Cytoscape app, which allows constructing biological network layouts based on the data from molecular profiles imported as values of node attributes. DeDaL is a Cytoscape 3 app, which uses linear and non-linear algorithms of dimension reduction to produce data-driven network layouts based on multidimensional data (typically gene expression). DeDaL implements several data pre-processing and layout post-processing steps such as continuous morphing between two arbitrary network layouts and aligning one network layout with respect to another one by rotating and mirroring. The combination of all these functionalities facilitates the creation of insightful network layouts representing both structural network features and correlation patterns in multivariate data. We demonstrate the added value of applying DeDaL in several practical applications, including an example of a large protein-protein interaction network.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DeDaL is a convenient tool for applying data dimensionality reduction methods and for designing insightful data displays based on data-driven layouts of biological networks, built within Cytoscape environment.

Marker genes are of great importance for determining cell identity, and for understanding tissue specific gene function and the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a new bioinformatics tool called MGFM (Marker Gene Finder in Microarray data) to predict marker genes from microarray gene expression data. Marker genes are identified through the grouping of samples of the same type with similar marker gene expression levels. We verified our approach using two microarray data sets from the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus public repository encompassing samples for similar sets of five human tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung). Comparison with another tool for tissue-specific gene identification and validation with literature-derived established tissue markers established functionality, accuracy and simplicity of our tool. Furthermore, top ranked marker genes were experimentally validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sets of predicted marker genes associated with the five selected tissues comprised well-known genes of particular importance in these tissues. The tool is freely available from the Bioconductor web site, and it is also provided as an online application integrated into the CellFinder platform ( http://cellfinder.org/analysis/marker ).<h4>Conclusions</h4>MGFM is a useful tool to predict tissue/cell type marker genes using microarray gene expression data.

26318525,[MEG]PLS: A pipeline for MEG data analysis and partial least squares statistics.,"The emphasis of modern neurobiological theories has recently shifted from the independent function of brain areas to their interactions in the context of whole-brain networks. As a result, neuroimaging methods and analyses have also increasingly focused on network discovery. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging modality that captures neural activity with a high degree of temporal specificity, providing detailed, time varying maps of neural activity. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis is a multivariate framework that can be used to isolate distributed spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity that differentiate groups or cognitive tasks, to relate neural activity to behavior, and to capture large-scale network interactions. Here we introduce [MEG]PLS, a MATLAB-based platform that streamlines MEG data preprocessing, source reconstruction and PLS analysis in a single unified framework. [MEG]PLS facilitates MRI preprocessing, including segmentation and coregistration, MEG preprocessing, including filtering, epoching, and artifact correction, MEG sensor analysis, in both time and frequency domains, MEG source analysis, including multiple head models and beamforming algorithms, and combines these with a suite of PLS analyses. The pipeline is open-source and modular, utilizing functions from FieldTrip (Donders, NL), AFNI (NIMH, USA), SPM8 (UCL, UK) and PLScmd (Baycrest, CAN), which are extensively supported and continually developed by their respective communities. [MEG]PLS is flexible, providing both a graphical user interface and command-line options, depending on the needs of the user.

26353840,Reveel: large-scale population genotyping using low-coverage sequencing data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Population low-coverage whole-genome sequencing is rapidly emerging as a prominent approach for discovering genomic variation and genotyping a cohort. This approach combines substantially lower cost than full-coverage sequencing with whole-genome discovery of low-allele frequency variants, to an extent that is not possible with array genotyping or exome sequencing. However, a challenging computational problem arises of jointly discovering variants and genotyping the entire cohort. Variant discovery and genotyping are relatively straightforward tasks on a single individual that has been sequenced at high coverage, because the inference decomposes into the independent genotyping of each genomic position for which a sufficient number of confidently mapped reads are available. However, in low-coverage population sequencing, the joint inference requires leveraging the complex linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in the cohort to compensate for sparse and missing data in each individual. The potentially massive computation time for such inference, as well as the missing data that confound low-frequency allele discovery, need to be overcome for this approach to become practical.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present Reveel, a novel method for single nucleotide variant calling and genotyping of large cohorts that have been sequenced at low coverage. Reveel introduces a novel technique for leveraging LD that deviates from previous Markov-based models, and which is aimed at computational efficiency as well as accuracy in capturing LD patterns present in rare haplotypes. We evaluate Reveel's performance through extensive simulations as well as real data from the 1000 Genomes Project, and show that it achieves higher accuracy in low-frequency allele discovery and substantially lower computation cost than previous state-of-the-art methods.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://reveel.stanford.edu/<h4>Contact</h4>: serafim@cs.stanford.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The RRE and ABCD2 scores were calculated within 7 days of symptom onset. The predictive outcome was ischemic stroke occurrence at 90 days. The receiver-operating characteristics curves were plotted, and the predictive value of the two models was assessed by computing the C statistics.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 221 eligible patients were prospectively enrolled, of whom 46 (20.81%) experienced a stroke within 90 days. The 90-day stroke risk in high-risk TSI patients (RRE =4) was 3.406-fold greater than in those at low risk (P <0.001). The C statistic of RRE (0.681; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.592-0.771) was statistically higher than that of ABCD2 score (0.546; 95% CI, 0.454-0.638; Z = 2.115; P = 0.0344) at 90 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The RRE score had a higher predictive value than the ABCD2 score for assessing the 90-day risk of stroke after TSI.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26395772,APTANI: a computational tool to select aptamers through sequence-structure motif analysis of HT-SELEX data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Aptamers are synthetic nucleic acid molecules that can bind biological targets in virtue of both their sequence and three-dimensional structure. Aptamers are selected using SELEX, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment, a technique that exploits aptamer-target binding affinity. The SELEX procedure, coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HT-SELEX), creates billions of random sequences capable of binding different epitopes on specific targets. Since this technique produces enormous amounts of data, computational analysis represents a critical step to screen and select the most biologically relevant sequences.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present APTANI, a computational tool to identify target-specific aptamers from HT-SELEX data and secondary structure information. APTANI builds on AptaMotif algorithm, originally implemented to analyze SELEX data; extends the applicability of AptaMotif to HT-SELEX data and introduces new functionalities, as the possibility to identify binding motifs, to cluster aptamer families or to compare output results from different HT-SELEX cycles. Tabular and graphical representations facilitate the downstream biological interpretation of results.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>APTANI is available at http://aptani.unimore.it.<h4>Contact</h4>silvio.bicciato@unimore.it<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26398339,Small Supernumerary Marker Chromosomes in Human Infertility.,"Small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) are structurally abnormal chromosomes that cannot be unambiguously identified by banding cytogenetics. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of sSMC frequency and characterization in a context of infertility and to review the literature describing sSMC in relation with male and female infertility. Therefore, a systematic literature review on sSMC associated with infertility was conducted by means of a PubMed literature and a sSMC database (http://ssmc-tl.com/sSMC.html) search. A total of 234 patients with infertility were identified as carriers of sSMC. All chromosomes, except chromosomes 10, 19 and the X, were involved in sSMC, and in 72% the sSMC originated from acrocentric chromosomes. Euchromatic imbalances were caused by the presence of sSMC in 30% of the cases. Putative genes have been identified in only 1.2% of sSMC associated with infertility. The implication of sSMC in infertility could be due to a partial trisomy of some genes but also to mechanical effects perturbing meiosis. Further precise molecular and interphase-architecture studies on sSMC are needed in the future to characterize the relationship between this chromosomal anomaly and human infertility.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26435838,Improving preparedness of medical students and junior doctors to manage patients with diabetes.,"<h4>Objective</h4>New medical graduates are the front-line staff in many hospital settings and manage patients with diabetes frequently. Prescribing is an area of concern for junior doctors, however, with insulin prescribing reported as a particular weakness. This study aimed to produce an educational intervention which aimed to improve preparedness to manage patients with diabetes and evaluate it using a mixed methods approach.<h4>Research design and methods</h4>An e-resource (http://www.diabetesscenariosforjuniordoctors.co.uk) was created to contain commonplace and authentic diabetes decision-making scenarios. -32 junior doctors (n=20) and year 5 students (n=12) in South West England worked through the scenarios while 'thinking aloud' and then undertook a semistructured interview. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. Participant confidence to manage patients with diabetes before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the educational intervention was also measured using a self-rating scale.<h4>Results</h4>Participants reported that patients with diabetes were daunting to manage because of the wide array of insulin products, their lack of confidence with chronic disease management and the difficulty of applying theory to practice. The e-resource was described as authentic, practical, and appropriate for the target audience. Junior doctors' self-rated confidence to manage patients with diabetes increased from 4.7 (of 10) before using the e-resource, to 6.4 immediately afterwards, and 6.8 6 weeks later. Medical students' confidence increased from 5.1 before, to 6.4 immediately afterwards, and 6.4 6 weeks later.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Providing opportunities to work with authentic scenarios in a safe environment can help to ameliorate junior doctors' lack of confidence to manage patients with diabetes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,clinical
26447265,"Pressure UlceR Programme Of reSEarch (PURPOSE): using mixed methods (systematic reviews, prospective cohort, case study, consensus and psychometrics) to identify patient and organisational risk, develop a risk assessment tool and patient-reported outcome Quality of Life and Health Utility measures","<h4>Background</h4>The Pressure UlceR Programme Of reSEarch (PURPOSE) consisted of two themes. Theme 1 focused on improving our understanding of individuals and organisational risk factors and on improving the quality of risk assessments (work packages 13) and theme 2 focused on developing patient-reported outcome measures (work packages 4 and 5).<h4>Methods</h4>The programme comprised 21 individual pieces of work. Pain: (1) multicentre pain prevalence study in acute hospitals, (2) multicentre pain prevalence study in community localities incorporating (3) a comparison of case-finding methods, and (4) multicentre, prospective cohort study. Severe pressure ulcers: (5) retrospective case study, (6) patient involvement workshop with the Pressure Ulcer Research Service User Network for the UK (PURSUN UK) and (7) development of root cause analysis methodology. Risk assessment: (8) systematic review, (9) consensus study, (10) conceptual framework development and theoretical causal pathway, (11) design and pretesting of draft Risk Assessment Framework and (12) field test to assess reliability, validity, data completeness and clinical usability. Quality of life: (13) conceptual framework development (systematic review, patient interviews), (14 and 15) provisional instrument development, with items generated from patient interviews [from (1) above] two systematic reviews and experts, (16) pretesting of the provisional Pressure Ulcer Quality of Life (PU-QOL) instrument using mixed methods, (17) field test 1 including (18) optimal mode of administration substudy and item reduction with testing of scale formation, acceptability, scaling assumptions, reliability and validity, and (19) field test 2  final psychometric evaluation to test scale targeting, item response categories, item fit, response bias, acceptability, scaling assumptions, reliability and validity. Costutility: (20) time trade-off task valuations of health states derived from selected PU-QOL items, and (21) validation of the items selected and psychometric properties of the new Pressure Ulcer Quality of Life Utility Index (PUQOL-UI).<h4>Key findings</h4>Pain: prevalence studies  hospital and community patients experience both pressure area-related and pressure ulcer pain; pain cohort study  indicates that pain is independently predictive of category 2 (and above) pressure ulcer development. Severe pressure ulcers: these were more likely to develop in contexts in which clinicians failed to listen to patients/carers or recognise/respond to high risk or the presence of an existing pressure ulcer and services were not effectively co-ordinated; service users found the interactive workshop format valuable; including novel components (interviews with patients and carers) in root cause analysis improves the quality of the insights captured. Risk assessment: we developed a Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment Framework, the PURPOSE-T, incorporating the Minimum Data Set, a screening stage, a full assessment stage, use of colour to support decision-making, and decision pathways that make a clear distinction between patients with an existing pressure ulcer(s) (or scarring from previous ulcers) who require secondary prevention and treatment and those at risk who require primary prevention (http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/accesspurposet). Quality of life: the final PU-QOL instrument consists of 10 scales to measure pain, exudate, odour, sleep, vitality, mobility/movement, daily activities, emotional well-being, self-consciousness and appearance, and participation (http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/puqol-ques). Costutility: seven items were selected from the PU-QOL instrument for inclusion in the PUQOL-UI (http://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/puqol-ui); secondary study analysis indicated that item selection for the PUQOL-UI was appropriate and that the index was acceptable to patients and had adequate levels of validity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The PURPOSE programme has provided important insights for pressure ulcer prevention and treatment and involvement of service users in research and development, with implications for patient and public involvement, clinical practice, quality/safety/health service management and research including replication of the pain risk factor study, work exploring best practice settings, the impact of including skin status as an indicator for escalation of preventative interventions, further psychometric evaluation of PU-QOL and PUQOL-UI the measurement of disease attribution.<h4>Funding</h4>The National Institute for Health Research Programme Grants for Applied Research programme.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26455800,ConTemplate Suggests Possible Alternative Conformations for a Query Protein of Known Structure.,"Protein function involves conformational changes, but often, for a given protein, only some of these conformations are known. The missing conformations could be predicted using the wealth of data in the PDB. Most PDB proteins have multiple structures, and proteins sharing one similar conformation often share others as well. The ConTemplate web server (http://bental.tau.ac.il/contemplate) exploits these observations to suggest conformations for a query protein with at least one known conformation (or model thereof). We demonstrate ConTemplate on a ribose-binding protein that undergoes significant conformational changes upon substrate binding. Querying ConTemplate with the ligand-free (or bound) structure of the protein produces the ligand-bound (or free) conformation with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.7 (or 2.2); the models are derived from conformations of other sugar-binding proteins, sharing approximately 30% sequence identity with the query. The calculation also suggests intermediate conformations and a pathway between the bound and free conformations.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26464967,neuTube 1.0: A New Design for Efficient Neuron Reconstruction Software Based on the SWC Format.,"Brain circuit mapping requires digital reconstruction of neuronal morphologies in complicated networks. Despite recent advances in automatic algorithms, reconstruction of neuronal structures is still a bottleneck in circuit mapping due to a lack of appropriate software for both efficient reconstruction and user-friendly editing. Here we present a new software design based on the SWC format, a standardized neuromorphometric format that has been widely used for analyzing neuronal morphologies or sharing neuron reconstructions via online archives such as NeuroMorpho.org. We have also implemented the design in our open-source software called neuTube 1.0. As specified by the design, the software is equipped with parallel 2D and 3D visualization and intuitive neuron tracing/editing functions, allowing the user to efficiently reconstruct neurons from fluorescence image data and edit standard neuron structure files produced by any other reconstruction software. We show the advantages of neuTube 1.0 by comparing it to two other software tools, namely Neuromantic and Neurostudio. The software is available for free at http://www.neutracing.com, which also hosts complete software documentation and video tutorials.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26477251,Spin labeling and Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) to Deconstruct Conformational Ensembles of HIV Protease.,"An understanding of macromolecular conformational equilibrium in biological systems is oftentimes essential to understand function, dysfunction, and disease. For the past few years, our lab has been utilizing site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, to characterize the conformational ensemble and ligand-induced conformational shifts of HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR). The biomedical importance of characterizing the fractional occupancy of states within the conformational ensemble critically impacts our hypothesis of a conformational selection mechanism of drug-resistance evolution in HIV-1PR. The purpose of the following chapter is to give a timeline perspective of our SDSL EPR approach to characterizing conformational sampling of HIV-1PR. We provide detailed instructions for the procedure utilized in analyzing distance profiles for HIV-1PR obtained from pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR). Specifically, we employ a version of PELDOR known as double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Data are processed with the software package """"DeerAnalysis"""" (http://www.epr.ethz.ch/software), which implements Tikhonov regularization (TKR), to generate a distance profile from electron spin-echo amplitude modulations. We assign meaning to resultant distance profiles based upon a conformational sampling model, which is described herein. The TKR distance profiles are reconstructed with a linear combination of Gaussian functions, which is then statistically analyzed. In general, DEER has proven powerful for observing structural ensembles in proteins and, more recently, nucleic acids. Our goal is to present our advances in order to aid readers in similar applications.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

While their role in cardiac disease is only starting to be understood, their involvement in cardiac hypertrophy is poorly known. We studied the association between lncRNAs and left ventricular hypertrophy using whole transcriptome microarrays. Wild-type mice and mice overexpressing the adenosine A2A receptor were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce left ventricular hypertrophy. Expression profiles of lncRNAs in the heart were characterized using genome-wide microarrays. An analytical pipeline was specifically developed to extract lncRNA data from microarrays. We identified 2 lncRNAs up-regulated and 3 lncRNAs down-regulated in the hearts of A2A-receptor overexpressing-mice subjected to TAC compared to wild-type mice. Differential expression of these 2 lncRNAs was validated by quantitative PCR. Complete microarray dataset is available at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accession number GSE45423.

26537179,BRANE Cut: biologically-related a priori network enhancement with graph cuts for gene regulatory network inference.,"<h4>Background</h4>Inferring gene networks from high-throughput data constitutes an important step in the discovery of relevant regulatory relationships in organism cells. Despite the large number of available Gene Regulatory Network inference methods, the problem remains challenging: the underdetermination in the space of possible solutions requires additional constraints that incorporate a priori information on gene interactions.<h4>Methods</h4>Weighting all possible pairwise gene relationships by a probability of edge presence, we formulate the regulatory network inference as a discrete variational problem on graphs. We enforce biologically plausible coupling between groups and types of genes by minimizing an edge labeling functional coding for a priori structures. The optimization is carried out with Graph cuts, an approach popular in image processing and computer vision. We compare the inferred regulatory networks to results achieved by the mutual-information-based Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) method and by the state-of-the-art GENIE3, winner of the DREAM4 multifactorial challenge.<h4>Results</h4>Our BRANE Cut approach infers more accurately the five DREAM4 in silico networks (with improvements from 6% to 11%). On a real Escherichia coli compendium, an improvement of 11.8% compared to CLR and 3% compared to GENIE3 is obtained in terms of Area Under Precision-Recall curve. Up to 48 additional verified interactions are obtained over GENIE3 for a given precision. On this dataset involving 4345 genes, our method achieves a performance similar to that of GENIE3, while being more than seven times faster. The BRANE Cut code is available at: http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~pirayre/Codes-GRN-BRANE-cut.html.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BRANE Cut is a weighted graph thresholding method. Using biologically sound penalties and data-driven parameters, it improves three state-of-the art GRN inference methods. It is applicable as a generic network inference post-processing, due to its computational efficiency.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

26581084,Transcriptator: An Automated Computational Pipeline to Annotate Assembled Reads and Identify Non Coding RNA.,"RNA-seq is a new tool to measure RNA transcript counts, using high-throughput sequencing at an extraordinary accuracy. It provides quantitative means to explore the transcriptome of an organism of interest. However, interpreting this extremely large data into biological knowledge is a problem, and biologist-friendly tools are lacking. In our lab, we developed Transcriptator, a web application based on a computational Python pipeline with a user-friendly Java interface. This pipeline uses the web services available for BLAST (Basis Local Search Alignment Tool), QuickGO and DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) tools. It offers a report on statistical analysis of functional and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation's enrichment. It helps users to identify enriched biological themes, particularly GO terms, pathways, domains, gene/proteins features and protein-protein interactions related informations. It clusters the transcripts based on functional annotations and generates a tabular report for functional and gene ontology annotations for each submitted transcript to the web server. The implementation of QuickGo web-services in our pipeline enable the users to carry out GO-Slim analysis, whereas the integration of PORTRAIT (Prediction of transcriptomic non coding RNA (ncRNA) by ab initio methods) helps to identify the non coding RNAs and their regulatory role in transcriptome. In summary, Transcriptator is a useful software for both NGS and array data. It helps the users to characterize the de-novo assembled reads, obtained from NGS experiments for non-referenced organisms, while it also performs the functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed transcripts/genes for both RNA-seq and micro-array experiments. It generates easy to read tables and interactive charts for better understanding of the data. The pipeline is modular in nature, and provides an opportunity to add new plugins in the future.

26626453,Fast dimension reduction and integrative clustering of multi-omics data using low-rank approximation: application to cancer molecular classification.,"<h4>Background</h4>One major goal of large-scale cancer omics study is to identify molecular subtypes for more accurate cancer diagnoses and treatments. To deal with high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data, a promising strategy is to find an effective low-dimensional subspace of the original data and then cluster cancer samples in the reduced subspace. However, due to data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods can integrative and efficiently find the principal low-dimensional manifold of the high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we proposed a novel low-rank approximation based integrative probabilistic model to fast find the shared principal subspace across multiple data types: the convexity of the low-rank regularized likelihood function of the probabilistic model ensures efficient and stable model fitting. Candidate molecular subtypes can be identified by unsupervised clustering hundreds of cancer samples in the reduced low-dimensional subspace. On testing datasets, our method LRAcluster (low-rank approximation based multi-omics data clustering) runs much faster with better clustering performances than the existing method. Then, we applied LRAcluster on large-scale cancer multi-omics data from TCGA. The pan-cancer analysis results show that the cancers of different tissue origins are generally grouped as independent clusters, except squamous-like carcinomas. While the single cancer type analysis suggests that the omics data have different subtyping abilities for different cancer types.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LRAcluster is a very useful method for fast dimension reduction and unsupervised clustering of large-scale multi-omics data.

26628858,Characterizing Cancer-Specific Networks by Integrating TCGA Data.,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) generates comprehensive genomic data for thousands of patients over more than 20 cancer types. TCGA data are typically whole-genome measurements of multiple genomic features, such as DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation, and gene expression, providing unique opportunities for investigating cancer mechanism from multiple molecular and regulatory layers. We propose a Bayesian graphical model to systemically integrate multi-platform TCGA data for inference of the interactions between different genomic features either within a gene or between multiple genes. The presence or absence of edges in the graph indicates the presence or absence of conditional dependence between genomic features. The inference is restricted to genes within a known biological network, but can be extended to any sets of genes. Applying the model to the same genes using patient samples in two different cancer types, we identify network components that are common as well as different between cancer types.

We compared both the prognostic and predictive value of histologic grades and genomic markers.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrieved publicly available cDNA microarray data from 1373 primary ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancers and developed a genomic signature simulated from Recurrence Online (http://www.recurrenceonline.com/) to calculate the recurrence score and risk using predefined sets of genes in the cDNA microarray. We then compared the prognostic and predictive information provided by histologic grade and genomic signature.<h4>Results</h4>Based on genomic signatures, 55%, 28%, and 17% of breast cancers were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively, whereas the histologic grades were I, II, and III in 22%, 59%, and 19% of breast cancers, respectively. Univariate analysis in the untreated cohort revealed that both histologic grade (overall P = .007) and genomic signature (P < .001) could predict prognosis. Results were similar using the genomic signature, with pathologic complete response rates of 4.6%, 5.7%, and 16.5% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk cancers, respectively. Neither biomarker was statistically significant in multivariate analysis for predictive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Genomic signature was better at identifying low-risk cases compared to histologic grade alone, but both markers had similar predictive values for NAC response. Better predictive biomarkers for NAC response are still needed.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource
26635139,An integrative somatic mutation analysis to identify pathways linked with survival outcomes across 19 cancer types.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Identification of altered pathways that are clinically relevant across human cancers is a key challenge in cancer genomics. Precise identification and understanding of these altered pathways may provide novel insights into patient stratification, therapeutic strategies and the development of new drugs. However, a challenge remains in accurately identifying pathways altered by somatic mutations across human cancers, due to the diverse mutation spectrum. We developed an innovative approach to integrate somatic mutation data with gene networks and pathways, in order to identify pathways altered by somatic mutations across cancers.<h4>Results</h4>We applied our approach to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of somatic mutations in 4790 cancer patients with 19 different types of tumors. Our analysis identified cancer-type-specific altered pathways enriched with known cancer-relevant genes and targets of currently available drugs. To investigate the clinical significance of these altered pathways, we performed consensus clustering for patient stratification using member genes in the altered pathways coupled with gene expression datasets from 4870 patients from TCGA, and multiple independent cohorts confirmed that the altered pathways could be used to stratify patients into subgroups with significantly different clinical outcomes. Of particular significance, certain patient subpopulations with poor prognosis were identified because they had specific altered pathways for which there are available targeted therapies. These findings could be used to tailor and intensify therapy in these patients, for whom current therapy is suboptimal.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The code is available at: http://www.taehyunlab.org<h4>Contact</h4>jhcheong@yuhs.ac or taehyun.hwang@utsouthwestern.edu or taehyun.cs@gmail.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

26678663,EC: an efficient error correction algorithm for short reads.,"<h4>Background</h4>In highly parallel next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques millions to billions of short reads are produced from a genomic sequence in a single run. Due to the limitation of the NGS technologies, there could be errors in the reads. The error rate of the reads can be reduced with trimming and by correcting the erroneous bases of the reads. It helps to achieve high quality data and the computational complexity of many biological applications will be greatly reduced if the reads are first corrected. We have developed a novel error correction algorithm called EC and compared it with four other state-of-the-art algorithms using both real and simulated sequencing reads.<h4>Results</h4>We have done extensive and rigorous experiments that reveal that EC is indeed an effective, scalable, and efficient error correction tool. Real reads that we have employed in our performance evaluation are Illumina-generated short reads of various lengths. Six experimental datasets we have utilized are taken from sequence and read archive (SRA) at NCBI. The simulated reads are obtained by picking substrings from random positions of reference genomes. To introduce errors, some of the bases of the simulated reads are changed to other bases with some probabilities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Error correction is a vital problem in biology especially for NGS data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, called Error Corrector (EC), for correcting substitution errors in biological sequencing reads. We plan to investigate the possibility of employing the techniques introduced in this research paper to handle insertion and deletion errors also.<h4>Software availability</h4>The implementation is freely available for non-commercial purposes.

This study describes a method PEPstrMOD, which is an updated version of PEPstr, developed specifically for predicting the structure of peptides containing natural and non-natural/modified residues.<h4>Results</h4>PEPstrMOD integrates Forcefield_NCAA and Forcefield_PTM force field libraries to handle 147 non-natural residues and 32 types of post-translational modifications respectively by performing molecular dynamics using AMBER. AMBER was also used to handle other modifications like peptide cyclization, use of D-amino acids and capping of terminal residues. In addition, GROMACS was used to implement 210 non-natural side-chains in peptides using SwissSideChain force field library. We evaluated the performance of PEPstrMOD on three datasets generated from Protein Data Bank; i) ModPep dataset contains 501 non-natural peptides, ii) ModPep16, a subset of ModPep, and iii) CyclicPep contains 34 cyclic peptides. We achieved backbone Root Mean Square Deviation between the actual and predicted structure of peptides in the range of 3.81-4.05 .<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, the method PEPstrMOD has been developed that predicts the structure of modified peptide from the sequence/structure given as input. We validated the PEPstrMOD application using a dataset of peptides having non-natural/modified residues. PEPstrMOD offers unique advantages that allow the users to predict the structures of peptides having i) natural residues, ii) non-naturally modified residues, iii) terminal modifications, iv) post-translational modifications, v) D-amino acids, and also allows extended simulation of predicted peptides.

Next-generation sequencing technology performs advantageously and effectively in genetic mapping and genome analysis of diverse genetic resources. Hence, we combined re-sequencing technology and a bin map strategy to construct an ultra-high-density bin map with thousands of bin markers to precisely map a quantitative trait locus.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we generated a linkage map containing 1,151,856 high quality SNPs between Mo17 and B73, which were verified in the maize intermated B73  Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 population. This resource is an excellent complement to existing maize genetic maps available in an online database (iPlant, http://data.maizecode.org/maize/qtl/syn10/ ). Moreover, in this population combined with the IBM Syn4 RIL population, we detected 135 QTLs for flowering time and plant height traits across the two populations.

Map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development was observed. Furthermore, an updated integrated map with 1,151,856 high-quality SNPs, 2,916 traditional markers and 6,618 bin markers was constructed. The data were deposited into the iPlant Discovery Environment (DE), which provides a fundamental resource of genetic data for the maize genetic research community.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings provide basic essential genetic data for the maize genetic research community. An updated IBM Syn10 population and a reliable, verified high-quality SNP set between Mo17 and B73 will aid in future molecular breeding efforts.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26716705,Correlated confocal and super-resolution imaging by VividSTORM.,"Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is rapidly gaining popularity in the life sciences as an efficient approach to visualize molecular distribution with nanoscale precision. However, it has been challenging to obtain and analyze such data within a cellular context in tissue preparations. Here we describe a 5-d tissue processing and immunostaining procedure that is optimized for SMLM, and we provide example applications to fixed mouse brain, heart and kidney tissues. We then describe how to perform correlated confocal and 3D-superresolution imaging on these sections, which allows the visualization of nanoscale protein localization within labeled subcellular compartments of identified target cells in a few minutes. Finally, we describe the use of VividSTORM (http://katonalab.hu/index.php/vividstorm), an open-source software for correlated confocal and SMLM image analysis, which facilitates the measurement of molecular abundance, clustering, internalization, surface density and intermolecular distances in a cell-specific and subcellular compartment-restricted manner. The protocol requires only basic skills in tissue staining and microscopy.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The lack of standardized and automated methodologies poses a challenge for the analysis and interpretation of RNA sequencing data. We critically compare and evaluate state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches and present a workflow that integrates the best performing data analysis, data evaluation and annotation methods in a Transparent, Reproducible and Automated PipeLINE (TRAPLINE) for RNA sequencing data processing (suitable for Illumina, SOLiD and Solexa).<h4>Results</h4>Comparative transcriptomics analyses with TRAPLINE result in a set of differentially expressed genes, their corresponding protein-protein interactions, splice variants, promoter activity, predicted miRNA-target interactions and files for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. The obtained results are combined into a single file for downstream analysis such as network construction. We demonstrate the value of the proposed pipeline by characterizing the transcriptome of our recently described stem cell derived antibiotic selected cardiac bodies ('aCaBs').<h4>Conclusion</h4>TRAPLINE supports NGS-based research by providing a workflow that requires no bioinformatics skills, decreases the processing time of the analysis and works in the cloud. The pipeline is implemented in the biomedical research platform Galaxy and is freely accessible via www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/RNAseqTRAPLINE or the specific Galaxy manual page (https://usegalaxy.org/u/mwolfien/p/trapline---manual).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26753561,iMiRNA-SSF: Improving the Identification of MicroRNA Precursors by Combining Negative Sets with Different Distributions.,"The identification of microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) helps in understanding regulator in biological processes. The performance of computational predictors depends on their training sets, in which the negative sets play an important role. In this regard, we investigated the influence of benchmark datasets on the predictive performance of computational predictors in the field of miRNA identification, and found that the negative samples have significant impact on the predictive results of various methods. We constructed a new benchmark set with different data distributions of negative samples. Trained with this high quality benchmark dataset, a new computational predictor called iMiRNA-SSF was proposed, which employed various features extracted from RNA sequences. Experimental results showed that iMiRNA-SSF outperforms three state-of-the-art computational methods. For practical applications, a web-server of iMiRNA-SSF was established at the website http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iMiRNA-SSF/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26756459,Intranasal or transdermal nicotine for the treatment of postoperative pain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Acute pain frequently occurs after surgical procedures. Nicotine has been explored as an adjunctive medication for management of postoperative pain.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effect of transdermal or intranasal nicotine administration on postoperative pain, opioid analgesic use, and opioid-related adverse events.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 20 March 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 3), EMBASE (1980 to 20 March 2014), and also databases of ongoing trials (www.controlled-trials.com/andhttp://clinicaltrials.gov/). We re-ran the search on 28 April 2015. We will assess the one study of interest when we update the review.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that evaluated the effects of perioperative (pre-, intra-, or postoperative) administration of nicotine on postoperative pain, opioid use, and opioid-related adverse events.We excluded all other studies.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts for eligibility and documented reasons for exclusion. In case of disagreement, a third author decided on the inclusion or exclusion of a trial report. When additional information was needed in order to decide if a trial should be included, one of the authors contacted the corresponding author of the trial in question.<h4>Main results</h4>Nine trials (666 participants) evaluated nicotine for postoperative pain. Nicotine may reduce postoperative pain scores at 24 hours by a small amount compared with placebo (eight trials, mean difference -0.88 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.58 to -0.18; low quality evidence). The effect on pain at one hour and 12 hours postoperatively was less certain (very low quality evidence). Statistical heterogeneity was substantial and not adequately explained by stratification of trials according to type of surgical procedure, smoking status, mode of nicotine administration, timing of administration, or assessed risk of bias. Excluding one trial at high risk of bias resulted in similar findings. The effect of nicotine on postoperative opioid use was uncertain due to small number of participants in the studies. Nicotine probably increases the risk of postoperative nausea (seven trials, RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50; moderate quality evidence). Three trials assessed sedation but the effect is very uncertain due to the very low quality of evidence. We found no evidence that nicotine increased the risk of vomiting (seven studies, risk difference (RD) 0.03, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.09; low quality evidence). The results from one single small trial were insufficient to establish whether nicotine led to an earlier hospital discharge (very low quality evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Based on evidence of generally low quality, nicotine may reduce postoperative pain at 24 hours compared with placebo, but the effects were relatively small (less than 1 point on a 10 point pain scale) and there was substantial heterogeneity in the results of our analyses. Nicotine does not appear to reduce postoperative use of opioids or opioid-related adverse events but probably increases the risk of nausea. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of nicotine for postoperative pain and to understand the optimal timing, dose, and method of delivery of nicotine.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26782957,A randomized clinical trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neoadjuvant therapy improves long-term survival after oesophagectomy, treating oesophageal cancer, but the evidence to date is insufficient to determine which of the two main neoadjuvant therapy types, chemotherapy (nCT) or chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), is more beneficial. We aimed to compare the effects of nCT with those of nCRT.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This multicentre trial, which was conducted in Sweden and Norway, recruited 181 patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or the gastro-oesophageal junction who were candidates for curative-intended treatment. The primary end point was histological complete response after neoadjuvant treatment, which has been shown to be correlated with increased long-term survival. Study participants were randomized to nCT or nCRT, followed by surgery with two-field lymphadenectomy. Three cycles of platin/5-fluorouracil were administered in both arms, whereas 40 Gy of concomitant radiotherapy was added in the nCRT arm.<h4>Results</h4>The trial met the primary end point, histological complete response being achieved in 28% after nCRT versus 9% after nCT (P = 0.002). Lymph-node metastases were observed in 62% in the nCT group versus 35% in the nCRT group (P = 0.001). The R0 resection rate was 87% after nCRT and 74% after nCT (P = 0.04). There was no difference in overall survival between the treatment arms.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The addition of radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in higher histological complete response rate, higher R0 resection rate, and a lower frequency of lymph-node metastases, without significantly affecting survival.<h4>Clinicaltrialsgov</h4>NCT01362127 (https://clinicaltrials.gov; The full study protocol was registered in the Clinical Trials Database).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The symptoms can be ameliorated or prevented by administering pharmacological doses of biotin. Since 2008, approximately 300 samples have been submitted to ARUP's Molecular Sequencing Laboratory for biotinidase mutation analysis. Of these, 48 novel alterations in the biotinidase gene have been identified. Correlating the individual's serum enzymatic activity with the genotype, we have been able to determine the effect of the novel alteration on enzyme activity and, thereby, determine its likelihood of being pathogenic in 44 of these individuals. The novel mutations and uncertain alterations have been added to the database established by ARUP (http://arup.utah.edu/database/BTD/BTD_welcome.phps) to help clinicians make decisions about management and to better counsel their patients based on their genotypes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not about the resource
26833341,Integrative analysis for identifying joint modular patterns of gene-expression and drug-response data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The underlying relationship between genomic factors and the response of diverse cancer drugs still remains unclear. A number of studies showed that the heterogeneous responses to anticancer treatments of patients were partly associated with their specific changes in gene expression and somatic alterations. The emerging large-scale pharmacogenomic data provide us valuable opportunities to improve existing therapies or to guide early-phase clinical trials of compounds under development. However, how to identify the underlying combinatorial patterns among pharmacogenomics data are still a challenging issue.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we adopted a sparse network-regularized partial least square (SNPLS) method to identify joint modular patterns using large-scale pairwise gene-expression and drug-response data. We incorporated a molecular network to the (sparse) partial least square model to improve the module accuracy via a network-based penalty. We first demonstrated the effectiveness of SNPLS using a set of simulation data and compared it with two typical methods. Further, we applied it to gene expression profiles for 13 321 genes and pharmacological profiles for 98 anticancer drugs across 641 cancer cell lines consisting of diverse types of human cancers. We identified 20 gene-drug co-modules, each of which consists of 30 cell lines, 137 genes and 2 drugs on average. The majority of identified co-modules have significantly functional implications and coordinated gene-drug associations. The modular analysis here provided us new insights into the molecular mechanisms of how drugs act and suggested new drug targets for therapy of certain types of cancers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A matlab package of SNPLS is available at http://page.amss.ac.cn/shihua.zhang/<h4>Contact</h4>: zsh@amss.ac.cn<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26893301,Clustering Genes of Common Evolutionary History.,"Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate tree using data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent-due to events such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer-it can be misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions have taken a mechanistic approach, by modeling specific processes. Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies might arise. Such """"process-agnostic"""" approaches typically infer a tree for each locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by 1) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast species and 2) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta We release treeCl, a new program to cluster genes of common evolutionary history (http://git.io/treeCl).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
26908244,CERAPP: Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project.,"<h4>Background</h4>Humans are exposed to thousands of man-made chemicals in the environment. Some chemicals mimic natural endocrine hormones and, thus, have the potential to be endocrine disruptors. Most of these chemicals have never been tested for their ability to interact with the estrogen receptor (ER). Risk assessors need tools to prioritize chemicals for evaluation in costly in vivo tests, for instance, within the U.S. EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.<h4>Objectives</h4>We describe a large-scale modeling project called CERAPP (Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project) and demonstrate the efficacy of using predictive computational models trained on high-throughput screening data to evaluate thousands of chemicals for ER-related activity and prioritize them for further testing.<h4>Methods</h4>CERAPP combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict ER activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure-activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. EPA, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist ER activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature. To overcome the limitations of single models, a consensus was built by weighting models on scores based on their evaluated accuracies.<h4>Results</h4>Individual model scores ranged from 0.69 to 0.85, showing high prediction reliabilities. Out of the 32,464 chemicals, the consensus model predicted 4,001 chemicals (12.3%) as high priority actives and 6,742 potential actives (20.8%) to be considered for further testing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This project demonstrated the possibility to screen large libraries of chemicals using a consensus of different in silico approaches. This concept will be applied in future projects related to other end points.<h4>Citation</h4>Mansouri K, Abdelaziz A, Rybacka A, Roncaglioni A, Tropsha A, Varnek A, Zakharov A, Worth A, Richard AM, Grulke CM, Trisciuzzi D, Fourches D, Horvath D, Benfenati E, Muratov E, Wedebye EB, Grisoni F, Mangiatordi GF, Incisivo GM, Hong H, Ng HW, Tetko IV, Balabin I, Kancherla J, Shen J, Burton J, Nicklaus M, Cassotti M, Nikolov NG, Nicolotti O, Andersson PL, Zang Q, Politi R, Beger RD, Todeschini R, Huang R, Farag S, Rosenberg SA, Slavov S, Hu X, Judson RS. 2016.<h4>Cerapp</h4>Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project.

Modern high-throughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct--but often complementary--information. However, the large amount of data adds burden to any inference task. Flexible Bayesian methods may reduce the necessity for strong modelling assumptions, but can also increase the computational burden. We present an improved implementation of a Bayesian correlated clustering algorithm, that permits integrated clustering to be routinely performed across multiple datasets, each with tens of thousands of items. By exploiting GPU based computation, we are able to improve runtime performance of the algorithm by almost four orders of magnitude. This permits analysis across genomic-scale data sets, greatly expanding the range of applications over those originally possible.

However, the information associated with genes and genetic markers for pumpkin is very limited. In order to identify new genes and to develop genetic markers, we performed a transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) of two contrasting pumpkin cultivars. Leaves and female flowers of cultivars, 'Big Moose' with large round fruits and 'Munchkin' with small round fruits, were harvested for total RNA extraction. We obtained a total of 6GB (Big Moose; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3056882) and 5GB (Munchkin; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3056883) sequence data (NCBI SRA database SRX1502732 and SRX1502735, respectively), which correspond to 18,055,786 and 14,824,292 150-base reads. After quality assessment, the clean sequences where 17,995,932 and 14,774,486 respectively. The numbers of total transcripts for 'Big Moose' and 'Munchkin' were 84,727 and 68,051, respectively. TransDecoder identified possible coding regions in assembled transcripts.

27030549,The advantage of laser-capture microdissection over whole tissue analysis in proteomic profiling studies.,"Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) offers a reliable cell population enrichment tool and has been successfully coupled to MS analysis. Despite this, most proteomic studies employ whole tissue lysate (WTL) analysis in the discovery of disease biomarkers and in profiling analyses. Furthermore, the influence of tissue heterogeneity in WTL analysis, nor its impact in biomarker discovery studies have been completely elucidated. In order to address this, we compared previously obtained high resolution MS data from a cohort of 38 breast cancer tissues, of which both LCM enriched tumor epithelial cells and WTL samples were analyzed. Label-free quantification (LFQ) analysis through MaxQuant software showed a significantly higher number of identified and quantified proteins in LCM enriched samples (3404) compared to WTLs (2837). Furthermore, WTL samples displayed a higher amount of missing data compared to LCM both at peptide and protein levels (p-value < 0.001). 2D analysis on co-expressed proteins revealed discrepant expression of immune system and lipid metabolisms related proteins between LCM and WTL samples. We hereby show that LCM better dissected the biology of breast tumor epithelial cells, possibly due to lower interference from surrounding tissues and highly abundant proteins.

27076459,Inferring microRNA-disease associations by random walk on a heterogeneous network with multiple data sources.,"Since the discovery of the regulatory function of microRNA (miRNA), increased attention has focused on identifying the relationship between miRNA and disease. It has been suggested that computational method are an efficient way to identify potential disease-related miRNAs for further confirmation using biological experiments. In this paper, we first highlighted three limitations commonly associated with previous computational methods. To resolve these limitations, we established disease similarity subnetwork and miRNA similarity subnetwork by integrating multiple data sources, where the disease similarity is composed of disease semantic similarity and disease functional similarity, and the miRNA similarity is calculated using the miRNA-target gene and miRNA-lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) associations. Then, a heterogeneous network was constructed by connecting the disease similarity subnetwork and the miRNA similarity subnetwork using the known miRNA-disease associations. We extended random walk with restart to predict miRNA-disease associations in the heterogeneous network. The leave-one-out cross-validation achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0:8049 across 341 diseases and 476 miRNAs. For five-fold cross-validation, our method achieved an AUC from 0:7970 to 0:9249 for 15 human diseases. Case studies further demonstrated the feasibility of our method to discover potential miRNA-disease associations.

27092486,Profilings of MicroRNAs in the Liver of Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) Infected with Flavobacterium columnare.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulation of many biological processes in eukaryotes, including pathogen infection and host interactions. Flavobacterium columnare (FC) infection can cause great economic loss of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) which is one of the most important cultured fish in the world. However, miRNAs in response to FC infection in common carp has not been characterized. To identify specific miRNAs involved in common carp infected with FC, we performed microRNA sequencing using livers of common carp infected with and without FC. A total of 698 miRNAs were identified, including 142 which were identified and deposited in the miRbase database (Available online: http://www.mirbase.org/) and 556 had only predicted miRNAs. Among the deposited miRNAs, eight miRNAs were first identified in common carp. Thirty of the 698 miRNAs were differentially expressed miRNAs (DIE-miRNAs) between the FC infected and control samples. From the DIE-miRNAs, seven were selected randomly and their expression profiles were confirmed to be consistent with the microRNA sequencing results using RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. In addition, a total of 27,363 target genes of the 30 DIE-miRNAs were predicted. The target genes were enriched in five Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and adherent junction. The miRNA expression profile of the liver of common carp infected with FC will pave the way for the development of effective strategies to fight against FC infection.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27102804,Using expected sequence features to improve basecalling accuracy of amplicon pyrosequencing data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Amplicon pyrosequencing targets a known genetic region and thus inherently produces reads highly anticipated to have certain features, such as conserved nucleotide sequence, and in the case of protein coding DNA, an open reading frame. Pyrosequencing errors, consisting mainly of nucleotide insertions and deletions, are on the other hand likely to disrupt open reading frames. Such an inverse relationship between errors and expectation based on prior knowledge can be used advantageously to guide the process known as basecalling, i.e. the inference of nucleotide sequence from raw sequencing data.<h4>Results</h4>The new basecalling method described here, named Multipass, implements a probabilistic framework for working with the raw flowgrams obtained by pyrosequencing. For each sequence variant Multipass calculates the likelihood and nucleotide sequence of several most likely sequences given the flowgram data. This probabilistic approach enables integration of basecalling into a larger model where other parameters can be incorporated, such as the likelihood for observing a full-length open reading frame at the targeted region. We apply the method to 454 amplicon pyrosequencing data obtained from a malaria virulence gene family, where Multipass generates 20 % more error-free sequences than current state of the art methods, and provides sequence characteristics that allow generation of a set of high confidence error-free sequences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This novel method can be used to increase accuracy of existing and future amplicon sequencing data, particularly where extensive prior knowledge is available about the obtained sequences, for example in analysis of the immunoglobulin VDJ region where Multipass can be combined with a model for the known recombining germline genes. Multipass is available for Roche 454 data at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MultiPass-1.0 , and the concept can potentially be implemented for other sequencing technologies as well.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27113639,Vapocoolants (cold spray) for pain treatment during intravenous cannulation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intravenous cannulation is a painful procedure that can provoke anxiety and stress. Injecting local anaesthetic can provide analgesia at the time of cannulation, but it is a painful procedure. Topical anaesthetic creams take between 30 and 90 minutes to produce an effect. A quicker acting analgesic allows more timely investigation and treatment. Vapocoolants have been used in this setting, but studies have reported mixed results.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine effects of vapocoolants on pain associated with intravenous cannulation in adults and children. To explore variables that might affect the performance of vapocoolants, including time required for application, distance from the skin when applied and time to cannulation. To look at adverse effects associated with the use of vapocoolants.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science and the http://clinicaltrials.gov/, http://www.controlled-trials.com/ and http://www.trialscentral.org/ databases to 1 May 2015. We applied no language restrictions. We also scanned the reference lists of included papers.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included all blinded and unblinded randomized controlled trials (RTCs) comparing any vapocoolant with placebo or control to reduce pain during intravenous cannulation in adults and children.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, contacted study authors for additional information and assessed included studies for risk of bias. We collected and analysed data for the primary outcome of pain during cannulation, and for the secondary outcomes of pain associated with application of the vapocoolant, first attempt success rate of intravenous cannulation, adverse events and participant satisfaction. We performed subgroup analyses for the primary outcome to examine differences based on age of participant, type of vapocoolant used, application time of vapocoolant and clinical situation (emergency vs elective). We used random-effects model meta-analysis in RevMan 5.3 and assessed heterogeneity between trial results by examining forest plots and calculating the I(2) statistic.<h4>Main results</h4>We found nine suitable studies of 1070 participants and included them in the qualitative analyses. We included eight studies of 848 participants in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome (pain during intravenous cannulation). Use of vapocoolants resulted in a reduction in pain scores as measured by a linear 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS 100) compared with controls (difference between means -12.5 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18.7 to -6.4 mm; moderate-quality evidence). We could not include in the meta-analysis one study, which showed no effects of the intervention.Use of vapocoolants resulted in increased pain scores at the time of application as measured by a VAS 100 compared with controls (difference between means 6.3 mm, 95% CI 2.2 to 10.3 mm; four studies, 461 participants; high-quality evidence) and led to no difference in first attempt success compared with controls (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; six studies, 812 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We documented eight minor adverse events reported in 279 vapocoolant participants (risk difference (RD) 0.03, 95% CI 0 to 0.05; five studies, 551 participants; low quality-evidence).The overall risk of bias of individual studies ranged from low to high, with high risk of bias for performance and detection bias in four studies. Sensitivity analysis showed that exclusion of studies at high or unclear risk of bias did not materially alter the results of this review.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Moderate-quality evidence indicates that use of a vapocoolant immediately before intravenous cannulation reduces pain during the procedure. Use of vapocoolant does not increase the difficulty of cannulation nor cause serious adverse effects but is associated with mild discomfort during application.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

27152837,Evaluation of OASIS QSAR Models Using ToxCast™ in Vitro Estrogen and Androgen Receptor Binding Data and Application in an Integrated Endocrine Screening Approach.,"<h4>Background</h4>Integrative testing strategies (ITSs) for potential endocrine activity can use tiered in silico and in vitro models. Each component of an ITS should be thoroughly assessed.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used the data from three in vitro ToxCast binding assays to assess OASIS, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) platform covering both estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) binding. For stronger binders (described here as AC50 < 1 M), we also examined the relationship of QSAR predictions of ER or AR binding to the results from 18 ER and 10 AR transactivation assays, 72 ER-binding reference compounds, and the in vivo uterotrophic assay.<h4>Methods</h4>NovaScreen binding assay data for ER (human, bovine, and mouse) and AR (human, chimpanzee, and rat) were used to assess the sensitivity, specificity, concordance, and applicability domain of two OASIS QSAR models. The binding strength relative to the QSAR-predicted binding strength was examined for the ER data. The relationship of QSAR predictions of binding to transactivation- and pathway-based assays, as well as to in vivo uterotrophic responses, was examined.<h4>Results</h4>The QSAR models had both high sensitivity (> 75%) and specificity (> 86%) for ER as well as both high sensitivity (92-100%) and specificity (70-81%) for AR. For compounds within the domains of the ER and AR QSAR models that bound with AC50 < 1 M, the QSAR models accurately predicted the binding for the parent compounds. The parent compounds were active in all transactivation assays where metabolism was incorporated and, except for those compounds known to require metabolism to manifest activity, all assay platforms where metabolism was not incorporated. Compounds in-domain and predicted to bind by the ER QSAR model that were positive in ToxCast ER binding at AC50 < 1 M were active in the uterotrophic assay.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We used the extensive ToxCast HTS binding data set to show that OASIS ER and AR QSAR models had high sensitivity and specificity when compounds were in-domain of the models. Based on this research, we recommend a tiered screening approach wherein a) QSAR is used to identify compounds in-domain of the ER or AR binding models and predicted to bind; b) those compounds are screened in vitro to assess binding potency; and c) the stronger binders (AC50 < 1 M) are screened in vivo. This scheme prioritizes compounds for integrative testing and risk assessment. Importantly, compounds that are not in-domain, that are predicted either not to bind or to bind weakly, that are not active in in vitro, that require metabolism to manifest activity, or for which in vivo AR testing is in order, need to be assessed differently.<h4>Citation</h4>Bhhatarai B, Wilson DM, Price PS, Marty S, Parks AK, Carney E. 2016.

27153703,Phasing for medical sequencing using rare variants and large haplotype reference panels.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>There is growing recognition that estimating haplotypes from high coverage sequencing of single samples in clinical settings is an important problem. At the same time very large datasets consisting of tens and hundreds of thousands of high-coverage sequenced samples will soon be available. We describe a method that takes advantage of these huge human genetic variation resources and rare variant sharing patterns to estimate haplotypes on single sequenced samples. Sharing rare variants between two individuals is more likely to arise from a recent common ancestor and, hence, also more likely to indicate similar shared haplotypes over a substantial flanking region of sequence.<h4>Results</h4>Our method exploits this idea to select a small set of highly informative copying states within a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) phasing algorithm. Using rare variants in this way allows us to avoid iterative MCMC methods to infer haplotypes. Compared to other approaches that do not explicitly use rare variants we obtain significant gains in phasing accuracy, less variation over phasing runs and improvements in speed. For example, using a reference panel of 7420 haplotypes from the UK10K project, we are able to reduce switch error rates by up to 50% when phasing samples sequenced at high-coverage. In addition, a single step rephasing of the UK10K panel, using rare variant information, has a downstream impact on phasing performance. These results represent a proof of concept that rare variant sharing patterns can be utilized to phase large high-coverage sequencing studies such as the 100 000 Genomes Project dataset.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A webserver that includes an implementation of this new method and allows phasing of high-coverage clinical samples is available at https://phasingserver.stats.ox.ac.uk/<h4>Contact</h4>marchini@stats.ox.ac.uk<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27164621,Prioritizing Chemicals for Risk Assessment Using Chemoinformatics: Examples from the IARC Monographs on Pesticides.,"<h4>Background</h4>Identifying cancer hazards is the first step towards cancer prevention. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs Programme, which has evaluated nearly 1,000 agents for their carcinogenic potential since 1971, typically selects agents for hazard identification on the basis of public nominations, expert advice, published data on carcinogenicity, and public health importance.<h4>Objectives</h4>Here, we present a novel and complementary strategy for identifying agents for hazard evaluation using chemoinformatics, database integration, and automated text mining.<h4>Discussion</h4>To inform selection among a broad range of pesticides nominated for evaluation, we identified and screened nearly 6,000 relevant chemical structures, after which we systematically compiled information on 980 pesticides, creating network maps that allowed cluster visualization by chemical similarity, pesticide class, and publicly available information concerning cancer epidemiology, cancer bioassays, and carcinogenic mechanisms. For the IARC Monograph meetings that took place in March and June 2015, this approach supported high-priority evaluation of glyphosate, malathion, parathion, tetrachlorvinphos, diazinon, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), lindane, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This systematic approach, accounting for chemical similarity and overlaying multiple data sources, can be used by risk assessors as well as by researchers to systematize, inform, and increase efficiency in selecting and prioritizing agents for hazard identification, risk assessment, regulation, or further investigation. This approach could be extended to an array of outcomes and agents, including occupational carcinogens, drugs, and foods. Citation: Guha N, Guyton KZ, Loomis D, Barupal DK. 2016.

27187006,Targeting vascular (endothelial) dysfunction.,"Cardiovascular diseases are major contributors to global deaths and disability-adjusted life years, with hypertension a significant risk factor for all causes of death. The endothelium that lines the inner wall of the vasculature regulates essential haemostatic functions, such as vascular tone, circulation of blood cells, inflammation and platelet activity. Endothelial dysfunction is an early predictor of atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular events. We review the prognostic value of obtaining measurements of endothelial function, the clinical techniques for its determination, the mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction and the therapeutic treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Since vascular oxidative stress and inflammation are major determinants of endothelial function, we have also addressed current antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. In the light of recent data that dispute the prognostic value of endothelial function in healthy human cohorts, we also discuss alternative diagnostic parameters such as vascular stiffness index and intima/media thickness ratio. We also suggest that assessing vascular function, including that of smooth muscle and even perivascular adipose tissue, may be an appropriate parameter for clinical investigations.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Redox Biology and Oxidative Stress in Health and Disease.

27268407,Tracking medical genetic literature through machine learning.,"There has been remarkable progress in identifying the causes of genetic conditions as well as understanding how changes in specific genes cause disease. Though difficult (and often superficial) to parse, an interesting tension involves emphasis on basic research aimed to dissect normal and abnormal biology versus more clearly clinical and therapeutic investigations. To examine one facet of this question and to better understand progress in Mendelian-related research, we developed an algorithm that classifies medical literature into three categories (Basic, Clinical, and Management) and conducted a retrospective analysis. We built a supervised machine learning classification model using the Azure Machine Learning (ML) Platform and analyzed the literature (1970-2014) from NCBI's Entrez Gene2Pubmed Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) using genes from the NHGRI's Clinical Genomics Database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/CGD/). We applied our model to 376,738 articles: 288,639 (76.6%) were classified as Basic, 54,178 (14.4%) as Clinical, and 24,569 (6.5%) as Management. The average classification accuracy was 92.2%. The rate of Clinical publication was significantly higher than Basic or Management. The rate of publication of article types differed significantly when divided into key eras: Human Genome Project (HGP) planning phase (1984-1990); HGP launch (1990) to publication (2001); following HGP completion to the """"Next Generation"""" advent (2009); the era following 2009. In conclusion, in addition to the findings regarding the pace and focus of genetic progress, our algorithm produced a database that can be used in a variety of contexts including automating the identification of management-related literature.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27296980,Unbiased probabilistic taxonomic classification for DNA barcoding.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>When targeted to a barcoding region, high-throughput sequencing can be used to identify species or operational taxonomical units from environmental samples, and thus to study the diversity and structure of species communities. Although there are many methods which provide confidence scores for assigning taxonomic affiliations, it is not straightforward to translate these values to unbiased probabilities. We present a probabilistic method for taxonomical classification (PROTAX) of DNA sequences. Given a pre-defined taxonomical tree structure that is partially populated by reference sequences, PROTAX decomposes the probability of one to the set of all possible outcomes. PROTAX accounts for species that are present in the taxonomy but that do not have reference sequences, the possibility of unknown taxonomical units, as well as mislabeled reference sequences. PROTAX is based on a statistical multinomial regression model, and it can utilize any kind of sequence similarity measures or the outputs of other classifiers as predictors.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate the performance of PROTAX by using as predictors the output from BLAST, the phylogenetic classification software TIPP, and the RDP classifier. We show that PROTAX improves the predictions of the baseline implementations of TIPP and RDP classifiers, and that it is able to combine complementary information provided by BLAST and TIPP, resulting in accurate and unbiased classifications even with very challenging cases such as 50% mislabeling of reference sequences.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Perl/R implementation of PROTAX is available at http://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/Software.htm<h4>Contact</h4>panu.somervuo@helsinki.fi<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27307608,Convolutional neural network architectures for predicting DNA-protein binding.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed conventional methods in modeling the sequence specificity of DNA-protein binding. Yet inappropriate CNN architectures can yield poorer performance than simpler models. Thus an in-depth understanding of how to match CNN architecture to a given task is needed to fully harness the power of CNNs for computational biology applications.<h4>Results</h4>We present a systematic exploration of CNN architectures for predicting DNA sequence binding using a large compendium of transcription factor datasets. We identify the best-performing architectures by varying CNN width, depth and pooling designs. We find that adding convolutional kernels to a network is important for motif-based tasks. We show the benefits of CNNs in learning rich higher-order sequence features, such as secondary motifs and local sequence context, by comparing network performance on multiple modeling tasks ranging in difficulty. We also demonstrate how careful construction of sequence benchmark datasets, using approaches that control potentially confounding effects like positional or motif strength bias, is critical in making fair comparisons between competing methods. We explore how to establish the sufficiency of training data for these learning tasks, and we have created a flexible cloud-based framework that permits the rapid exploration of alternative neural network architectures for problems in computational biology.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All the models analyzed are available at http://cnn.csail.mit.edu<h4>Contact</h4>gifford@mit.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27307636,DFLpred: High-throughput prediction of disordered flexible linker regions in protein sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Disordered flexible linkers (DFLs) are disordered regions that serve as flexible linkers/spacers in multi-domain proteins or between structured constituents in domains. They are different from flexible linkers/residues because they are disordered and longer. Availability of experimentally annotated DFLs provides an opportunity to build high-throughput computational predictors of these regions from protein sequences. To date, there are no computational methods that directly predict DFLs and they can be found only indirectly by filtering predicted flexible residues with predictions of disorder.<h4>Results</h4>We conceptualized, developed and empirically assessed a first-of-its-kind sequence-based predictor of DFLs, DFLpred. This method outputs propensity to form DFLs for each residue in the input sequence. DFLpred uses a small set of empirically selected features that quantify propensities to form certain secondary structures, disordered regions and structured regions, which are processed by a fast linear model. Our high-throughput predictor can be used on the whole-proteome scale; it needs <1 h to predict entire proteome on a single CPU. When assessed on an independent test dataset with low sequence-identity proteins, it secures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal 0.715 and outperforms existing alternatives that include methods for the prediction of flexible linkers, flexible residues, intrinsically disordered residues and various combinations of these methods. Prediction on the complete human proteome reveals that about 10% of proteins have a large content of over 30% DFL residues. We also estimate that about 6000 DFL regions are long with =30 consecutive residues.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/DFLpred/<h4>Contact</h4>lkurgan@vcu.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27307645,BioASF: a framework for automatically generating executable pathway models specified in BioPAX.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Biological pathways play a key role in most cellular functions. To better understand these functions, diverse computational and cell biology researchers use biological pathway data for various analysis and modeling purposes. For specifying these biological pathways, a community of researchers has defined BioPAX and provided various tools for creating, validating and visualizing BioPAX models. However, a generic software framework for simulating BioPAX models is missing. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by introducing a generic simulation framework for BioPAX. The framework explicitly separates the execution model from the model structure as provided by BioPAX, with the advantage that the modelling process becomes more reproducible and intrinsically more modular; this ensures natural biological constraints are satisfied upon execution. The framework is based on the principles of discrete event systems and multi-agent systems, and is capable of automatically generating a hierarchical multi-agent system for a given BioPAX model.<h4>Results</h4>To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, we simulated two types of biological network models: a gene regulatory network modeling the haematopoietic stem cell regulators and a signal transduction network modeling the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. We observed that the results of the simulations performed using our framework were entirely consistent with the simulation results reported by the researchers who developed the original models in a proprietary language.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The framework, implemented in Java, is open source and its source code, documentation and tutorial are available at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/BioASF CONTACT: j.heringa@vu.nl.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

We tested the method on human contigs; using human UniProt proteins as guides, the improvement on N50 size was 17% increase with an accuracy of ~97%. PEP_scaffolder improved the proportion of fully covered proteins among all proteins, which was close to the proportion in the finished genome.

These data sources can be temporally limited, spatially aggregated, subjective, and burdensome for the patient to collect.<h4>Objectives</h4>First, we aimed to test the feasibility of collecting rescue inhaler use data in space-time using electronic sensors. Second, we aimed to evaluate whether these data have the potential to identify environmental triggers and built environment factors associated with rescue inhaler use and to determine whether these findings would be consistent with the existing literature.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized zero-truncated negative binomial models to identify triggers associated with inhaler use, and implemented three sensitivity analyses to validate our findings.<h4>Results</h4>Electronic sensors fitted on metered dose inhalers tracked 5,660 rescue inhaler use events in space and time for 140 participants from 13 June 2012 to 28 February 2014. We found that the inhaler sensors were feasible in passively collecting objective rescue inhaler use data. We identified several environmental triggers with a positive and significant association with inhaler use, including: AQI, PM10, weed pollen, and mold. Conversely, the spatial distribution of tree cover demonstrated a negative and significant association with inhaler use.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Utilizing a sensor to capture the signal of rescue inhaler use in space-time offered a passive and objective signal of asthma activity. This approach enabled detailed analyses to identify environmental triggers and built environment factors that are associated with asthma symptoms beyond the residential address. The application of these new technologies has the potential to improve our surveillance and understanding of asthma.

27397138,Dynamic Bayesian Network for Accurate Detection of Peptides from Tandem Mass Spectra.,"A central problem in mass spectrometry analysis involves identifying, for each observed tandem mass spectrum, the corresponding generating peptide. We present a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) toolkit that addresses this problem by using a machine learning approach. At the heart of this toolkit is a DBN for Rapid Identification (DRIP), which can be trained from collections of high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). DRIP's score function considers fragment ion matches using Gaussians rather than fixed fragment-ion tolerances and also finds the optimal alignment between the theoretical and observed spectrum by considering all possible alignments, up to a threshold that is controlled using a beam-pruning algorithm. This function not only yields state-of-the art database search accuracy but also can be used to generate features that significantly boost the performance of the Percolator postprocessor. The DRIP software is built upon a general purpose DBN toolkit (GMTK), thereby allowing a wide variety of options for user-specific inference tasks as well as facilitating easy modifications to the DRIP model in future work.

We developed a Korean fracture risk prediction model using clinical risk factors and assessed validity of the final model.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 718,306 Korean men and women aged 50-90 years were followed for 7 years in a national system-based cohort study. In total, 50% of the subjects were assigned randomly to the development dataset and 50% were assigned to the validation dataset. Clinical risk factors for osteoporotic fracture were assessed at the biennial health check. Data on osteoporotic fractures during the follow-up period were identified by ICD-10 codes and the nationwide database of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS).<h4>Results</h4>During the follow-up period, 19,840 osteoporotic fractures were reported (4,889 in men and 14,951 in women) in the development dataset. The assessment tool called the Korean Fracture Risk Score (KFRS) is comprised of a set of nine variables, including age, body mass index, recent fragility fracture, current smoking, high alcohol intake, lack of regular exercise, recent use of oral glucocorticoid, rheumatoid arthritis, and other causes of secondary osteoporosis. The KFRS predicted osteoporotic fractures over the 7 years. This score was validated using an independent dataset. A close relationship with overall fracture rate was observed when we compared the mean predicted scores after applying the KFRS with the observed risks after 7 years within each 10th of predicted risk.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a Korean specific prediction model for osteoporotic fractures. The KFRS was able to predict risk of fracture in the primary population without bone mineral density testing and is therefore suitable for use in both clinical setting and self-assessment.

27430689,[Association between polymorphism in Vav3 genes and risk of primary prostatic cancer in Chinese Han population].,"<h4>Objective</h4>To study the associations between genetic variations of Vav3 gene and prostate cancer susceptibility.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were collected in a hospital-based and case-control study of 1 015 prostate cancer cases and 1 068 cancer-free controls collecting from a period of time between 2008 and 2012. Based on the online database, NCBI dbSNP (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP) and SNPinfo (http: //snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpfunc.htm). Functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Vav3 were screened and genotyped, and assessed their associations with risk of prostate cancer by using logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the associations between SNPs of Vav3 and some clinicopathological parameters were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Among the two SNPs investigated, only Vav3 rs12410676 G>A was associated with decreased prostate cancer risk [additive model, OR=0.80 (0.69-0.93), P=0.003; dominant model, OR=0.81 (0.68-0.97), P=0.022; recessive model, OR=0.54 (0.36-0.82), P=0.004]. The combined effect of Vav3 rs8676 G>A and rs12410676 G>A was found as a decreased prostate cancer risk along with the increased variant alleles (P<0.05). Specifically, participants carrying Vav3 rs12410676 AA/AG genotypes were more likely to be at lower prostate cancer risk, compared with participants carrying GG genotypes, in groups of BMI=25 kg/m(2,) smoking, Gleason>7(4+ 3), and higher invasive prostate cancer. Finally, some positive findings were evidently significant with false positive report probability values at different prior probability levels (0.25, 0.1 and 0.01).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Vav3 SNPs may contribute to the risk of prostate cancer in Eastern Chinese men, but the effect is weak and needs further validation by larger, multicenter and ethnic-based studies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27447888,MBMC: An Effective Markov Chain Approach for Binning Metagenomic Reads from Environmental Shotgun Sequencing Projects.,"Metagenomics is a next-generation omics field currently impacting postgenomic life sciences and medicine. Binning metagenomic reads is essential for the understanding of microbial function, compositions, and interactions in given environments. Despite the existence of dozens of computational methods for metagenomic read binning, it is still very challenging to bin reads. This is especially true for reads from unknown species, from species with similar abundance, and/or from low-abundance species in environmental samples. In this study, we developed a novel taxonomy-dependent and alignment-free approach called MBMC (Metagenomic Binning by Markov Chains). Different from all existing methods, MBMC bins reads by measuring the similarity of reads to the trained Markov chains for different taxa instead of directly comparing reads with known genomic sequences. By testing on more than 24 simulated and experimental datasets with species of similar abundance, species of low abundance, and/or unknown species, we report here that MBMC reliably grouped reads from different species into separate bins. Compared with four existing approaches, we demonstrated that the performance of MBMC was comparable with existing approaches when binning reads from sequenced species, and superior to existing approaches when binning reads from unknown species. MBMC is a pivotal tool for binning metagenomic reads in the current era of Big Data and postgenomic integrative biology.

27456943,Current Trends of Lung Cancer Surgery and Demographic and Social Factors Related to Changes in the Trends of Lung Cancer Surgery: An Analysis of the National Database from 2010 to 2014.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>We investigated current trends in lung cancer surgery and identified demographic and social factors related to changes in these trends.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We estimated the incidence of lung cancer surgery using a procedure code-based approach provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (http://opendata.hira.or.kr). The population data were obtained every year from 2010 to 2014 from the Korean Statistical Information Service (http://kosis.kr/). The annual percent change (APC) and statistical significance were calculated using the Joinpoint software.<h4>Results</h4>From January 2010 to December 2014, 25,687 patients underwent 25,921 lung cancer surgeries, which increased by 45.1% from 2010 to 2014. The crude incidence rate of lung cancer surgery in each year increased significantly (APC, 9.5; p < 0.05). The male-to-female ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.6 (APC, -6.3; p < 0.05). The incidence increased in the age group of = 70 years for both sexes (male: APC, 3.7; p < 0.05; female: APC, 5.96; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the proportion of female patients aged = 65 years increased (APC, 7.2; p < 0.05), while that of male patients aged < 65 years decreased (APC, -3.9; p < 0.05). The proportions of segmentectomies (APC, 17.8; p < 0.05) and lobectomies (APC, 7.5; p < 0.05) increased, while the proportion of pneumonectomies decreased (APC, -6.3; p < 0.05). Finally, the proportion of patients undergoing surgery in Seoul increased (APC, 1.1; p < 0.05), while the proportion in other areas decreased (APC, -1.5; p < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>An increase in the use of lung cancer surgery in elderly patients and female patients, and a decrease in the proportion of patients requiring extensive pulmonary resection were identified. Furthermore, centralization of lung cancer surgery was noted.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27460614,Classifying Schizophrenia Using Multimodal Multivariate Pattern Recognition Analysis: Evaluating the Impact of Individual Clinical Profiles on the Neurodiagnostic Performance.,"Previous studies have shown that structural brain changes are among the best-studied candidate markers for schizophrenia (SZ) along with functional connectivity (FC) alterations of resting-state (RS) patterns. This study aimed to investigate effects of clinical and sociodemographic variables on the classification by applying multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to both gray matter (GM) volume and FC measures in patients with SZ and healthy controls (HC). RS and structural magnetic resonance imaging data (sMRI) from 74 HC and 71 SZ patients were obtained from a Mind Research Network COBRE dataset available via COINS (http://coins.mrn.org/dx). We used a MVPA framework using support-vector machines embedded in a repeated, nested cross-validation to generate a multi-modal diagnostic system and evaluate its generalizability. The dependence of neurodiagnostic performance on clinical and sociodemographic variables was evaluated. The RS classifier showed a slightly higher accuracy (70.5%) compared to the structural classifier (69.7%). The combination of sMRI and RS outperformed single MRI modalities classification by reaching 75% accuracy. The RS based moderator analysis revealed that the neurodiagnostic performance was driven by older SZ patients with an earlier illness onset and more pronounced negative symptoms. In contrast, there was no linear relationship between the clinical variables and neuroanatomically derived group membership measures. This study achieved higher accuracy distinguishing HC from SZ patients by fusing 2 imaging modalities. In addition the results of RS based moderator analysis showed that age of patients, as well as their age at the illness onset were the most important clinical features.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

PASS predicted biological activity profiles are used as independent input variables for QSAR modelling with SCR. QSAR models were developed using LD50 values for compounds tested on rats with four types of administration (oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous). The proposed method was evaluated on the set of compounds tested for acute rat toxicity with oral administration (7286 compounds) used for testing the known QSAR methods in T.E.S.T. 3.0 program (U.S. EPA). The several other sets of compounds tested for acute rat toxicity by different routes of administration selected from SYMYX MDL Toxicity Database were used too. The method was compared with the results of prediction of acute rodent toxicity for noncongeneric sets obtained by ACD/Labs Inc. The test sets were predicted with regards to the applicability domain. Comparison of accuracy for QSAR models obtained separately using QNA descriptors, PASS predictions, nearest neighbours' assessment with consensus models clearly demonstrated the benefits of consensus prediction.

27502039,Fascin Is Critical for the Maintenance of Breast Cancer Stem Cell Pool Predominantly via the Activation of the Notch Self-Renewal Pathway.,"An emerging dogma shows that tumors are initiated and maintained by a subpopulation of cancer cells that hijack some stem cell features and thus referred to as """"cancer stem cells"""" (CSCs). The exact mechanism that regulates the maintenance of CSC pool remains largely unknown. Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that we have previously demonstrated to be a major regulator of breast cancer chemoresistance and metastasis, two cardinal features of CSCs. Here, we manipulated fascin expression in breast cancer cell lines and used several in vitro and in vivo approaches to examine the relationship between fascin expression and breast CSCs. Fascin knockdown significantly reduced stem cell-like phenotype (CD44<sup>hi</sup> /CD24<sup>lo</sup> and ALDH<sup>+</sup> ) and reversal of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Interestingly, expression of the embryonic stem cell transcriptional factors (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and Klf4) was significantly reduced when fascin expression was down-regulated. Functionally, fascin-knockdown cells were less competent in forming colonies and tumorspheres, consistent with lower basal self-renewal activity and higher susceptibility to chemotherapy. Fascin effect on CSC chemoresistance and self-renewability was associated with Notch signaling. Activation of Notch induced the relevant downstream targets predominantly in the fascin-positive cells. Limiting-dilution xenotransplantation assay showed higher frequency of tumor-initiating cells in the fascin-positive group. Collectively, our data demonstrated fascin as a critical regulator of breast CSC pool at least partially via activation of the Notch self-renewal signaling pathway and modification of the expression embryonic transcriptional factors. Targeting fascin may halt CSCs and thus presents a novel therapeutic approach for effective treatment of breast cancer.

In this paper, I propose the weighted K-means support vector machine (wKM-SVM) and weighted support vector machine (wSVM), for which I allow the SVM to impose weights to the loss term. Besides, I demonstrate the numerical relations between the objective function of the SVM and weights. Motivated by general ensemble techniques, which are known to improve accuracy, I directly adopt the boosting algorithm to the newly proposed weighted KM-SVM (and wSVM). For predictive performance, a range of simulation studies demonstrate that the weighted KM-SVM (and wSVM) with boosting outperforms the standard KM-SVM (and SVM) including but not limited to many popular classification rules. I applied the proposed methods to simulated data and two large-scale real applications in the TCGA pan-cancer methylation data of breast and kidney cancer. In conclusion, the weighted KM-SVM (and wSVM) increases accuracy of the classification model, and will facilitate disease diagnosis and clinical treatment decisions to benefit patients.

27531102,iRSpot-EL: identify recombination spots with an ensemble learning approach.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Coexisting in a DNA system, meiosis and recombination are two indispensible aspects for cell reproduction and growth. With the avalanche of genome sequences emerging in the post-genomic age, it is an urgent challenge to acquire the information of DNA recombination spots because it can timely provide very useful insights into the mechanism of meiotic recombination and the process of genome evolution.<h4>Results</h4>To address such a challenge, we have developed a predictor, called IRSPOT-EL: , by fusing different modes of pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition and mode of dinucleotide-based auto-cross covariance into an ensemble classifier of clustering approach. Five-fold cross tests on a widely used benchmark dataset have indicated that the new predictor remarkably outperforms its existing counterparts. Particularly, far beyond their reach, the new predictor can be easily used to conduct the genome-wide analysis and the results obtained are quite consistent with the experimental map.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for iRSpot-EL has been established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iRSpot-EL/, by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.<h4>Contact</h4>bliu@gordonlifescience.org or bliu@insun.hit.edu.cnSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

27559155,Fast-SNP: a fast matrix pre-processing algorithm for efficient loopless flux optimization of metabolic models.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Computation of steady-state flux solutions in large metabolic models is routinely performed using flux balance analysis based on a simple LP (Linear Programming) formulation. A minimal requirement for thermodynamic feasibility of the flux solution is the absence of internal loops, which are enforced using 'loopless constraints'. The resulting loopless flux problem is a substantially harder MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem, which is computationally expensive for large metabolic models.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a pre-processing algorithm that significantly reduces the size of the original loopless problem into an easier and equivalent MILP problem. The pre-processing step employs a fast matrix sparsification algorithm-Fast- sparse null-space pursuit (SNP)-inspired by recent results on SNP. By finding a reduced feasible 'loop-law' matrix subject to known directionalities, Fast-SNP considerably improves the computational efficiency in several metabolic models running different loopless optimization problems. Furthermore, analysis of the topology encoded in the reduced loop matrix enabled identification of key directional constraints for the potential permanent elimination of infeasible loops in the underlying model. Overall, Fast-SNP is an effective and simple algorithm for efficient formulation of loop-law constraints, making loopless flux optimization feasible and numerically tractable at large scale.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code for MATLAB including examples is freely available for download at http://www.aibn.uq.edu.au/cssb-resources under Software.

27596593,Order restricted inference for oscillatory systems for detecting rhythmic signals.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Many biological processes, such as cell cycle, circadian clock, menstrual cycles, are governed by oscillatory systems consisting of numerous components that exhibit rhythmic patterns over time. It is not always easy to identify such rhythmic components. For example, it is a challenging problem to identify circadian genes in a given tissue using time-course gene expression data. There is a great potential for misclassifying non-rhythmic as rhythmic genes and vice versa. This has been a problem of considerable interest in recent years. In this article we develop a constrained inference based methodology called Order Restricted Inference for Oscillatory Systems (ORIOS) to detect rhythmic signals. Instead of using mathematical functions (e.g. sinusoidal) to describe shape of rhythmic signals, ORIOS uses mathematical inequalities. Consequently, it is robust and not limited by the biologist's choice of the mathematical model. We studied the performance of ORIOS using simulated as well as real data obtained from mouse liver, pituitary gland and data from NIH3T3, U2OS cell lines. Our results suggest that, for a broad collection of patterns of gene expression, ORIOS has substantially higher power to detect true rhythmic genes in comparison to some popular methods, while also declaring substantially fewer non-rhythmic genes as rhythmic.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A user friendly code implemented in R language can be downloaded from http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/staff/peddada/index.cfm CONTACT: peddada@niehs.nih.gov.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27597880,Functional networks inference from rule-based machine learning models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Functional networks play an important role in the analysis of biological processes and systems. The inference of these networks from high-throughput (-omics) data is an area of intense research. So far, the similarity-based inference paradigm (e.g. gene co-expression) has been the most popular approach. It assumes a functional relationship between genes which are expressed at similar levels across different samples. An alternative to this paradigm is the inference of relationships from the structure of machine learning models. These models are able to capture complex relationships between variables, that often are different/complementary to the similarity-based methods.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a protocol to infer functional networks from machine learning models, called FuNeL. It assumes, that genes used together within a rule-based machine learning model to classify the samples, might also be functionally related at a biological level. The protocol is first tested on synthetic datasets and then evaluated on a test suite of 8 real-world datasets related to human cancer. The networks inferred from the real-world data are compared against gene co-expression networks of equal size, generated with 3 different methods. The comparison is performed from two different points of view. We analyse the enriched biological terms in the set of network nodes and the relationships between known disease-associated genes in a context of the network topology. The comparison confirms both the biological relevance and the complementary character of the knowledge captured by the FuNeL networks in relation to similarity-based methods and demonstrates its potential to identify known disease associations as core elements of the network. Finally, using a prostate cancer dataset as a case study, we confirm that the biological knowledge captured by our method is relevant to the disease and consistent with the specialised literature and with an independent dataset not used in the inference process.<h4>Availability</h4>The implementation of our network inference protocol is available at: http://ico2s.org/software/funel.html.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27604408,ExonImpact: Prioritizing Pathogenic Alternative Splicing Events.,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a closely regulated process that allows a single gene to encode multiple protein isoforms, thereby contributing to the diversity of the proteome. Dysregulation of the splicing process has been found to be associated with many inherited diseases. However, among the pathogenic AS events, there are numerous """"passenger"""" events whose inclusion or exclusion does not lead to significant changes with respect to protein function. In this study, we evaluate the secondary and tertiary structural features of proteins associated with disease-causing and neutral AS events, and show that several structural features are strongly associated with the pathological impact of exon inclusion. We further develop a machine-learning-based computational model, ExonImpact, for prioritizing and evaluating the functional consequences of hitherto uncharacterized AS events. We evaluated our model using several strategies including cross-validation, and data from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and ClinVar databases.

Delile, 1813, is the most widespread seagrass of the Mediterranean Sea. This foundation species forms large meadows that, through habitat and trophic services, act as biodiversity hotspots. In Neptune grass meadows, amphipod crustaceans are one of the dominant groups of vagile invertebrates, forming an abundant and diverse taxocenosis. They are key ecological components of the complex, pivotal, yet critically endangered Neptune grass ecosystems. Nevertheless, comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data about amphipod fauna found in Mediterranean Neptune grass meadows remain scarce, especially in insular locations.<h4>New information</h4>Here, we provide in-depth metadata about AxIOM, a sample-based dataset published on the GBIF portal.

Although there are existing tools available, the steep learning curve prevents the wider community of environmental engineers and chemists to adopt those tools. Stemming from classical chemical equilibrium codes, MINEQL+ has been one of the most widely used chemical equilibrium software programs. We developed a spreadsheet-based tool, which we are calling MINFIT, that interacts with MINEQL+ to perform parameter estimations that optimize model fits to experimental data sets. MINFIT enables automatic and convenient screening of a large number of parameter sets toward the optimal solutions by calling MINEQL+ to perform iterative forward calculations following either exhaustive equidistant grid search or randomized search algorithms. The combined use of the two algorithms can securely guide the searches for the global optima. We developed interactive interfaces so that the optimization processes are transparent.

Experience and data of already existing monitoring networks should be included. The present paper summarizes the major findings of a project funded by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (Nutzungsmglichkeiten der Boden-Dauerbeobachtung der Lnder fr das Monitoring der Umweltwirkungen gentechnisch vernderter Pflanzen. BfN Skripten, Bonn-Bad Godesberg 369, 2014). The full report in german language can be accessed on http://www.bfn.deand is available as Additional file 1. The aim of the project was to check if it is possible to use the German permanent soil monitoring program (PSM) for the monitoring of GMO. Soil organism communities are highly diverse and relevant with respect to the sustainability of soil functions. They are exposed to GMO material directly by feeding or indirectly through food chain interactions. Other impacts are possible due to their close association to soil particles.<h4>Results</h4>The PSM program can be considered as representative with regard to different soil types and ecoregions in Germany, but not for all habitat types relevant for soil organisms. Nevertheless, it is suitable as a basic grid for monitoring the potential effects of GMO on soil invertebrates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PSM sites should be used to derive reference values, i.e. range of abundance and presence of different relevant species of soil organisms. Based on these references, it is possible to derive threshold values to define the limit of acceptable change or impact. Therefore, a minimum set of sites and minimum set of standardized methods are needed, i.e. characterization of each site, sampling of selected soil organism groups, adequate adaptation of methods for the purpose of monitoring of potential effects of GMO. Finally, and probably most demanding, it is needed to develop a harmonized evaluation concept.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
27796840,An IoT-cloud Based Wearable ECG Monitoring System for Smart Healthcare.,"Public healthcare has been paid an increasing attention given the exponential growth human population and medical expenses. It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Previous studies indicate that behavioral interventions might be a useful adjunct to medication in children with residual ADHD symptoms, and regarding comorbid oppositional symptoms and multiple domains of functional impairment. In the present study, we examined whether a telephone-assisted self-help (TASH) parenting behavioral intervention (written materials plus telephone counseling) enhanced the effects of methylphenidate treatment in children with ADHD.<h4>Methods</h4>In this randomized controlled trial, parents of 103 school-aged children with ADHD and residual functional impairment despite methylphenidate treatment were randomly assigned to either the enhancement group, which received the TASH intervention as adjunct to routine clinical care (including continued medication), or to the active control group, which received routine clinical care only (including continued medication). Parent-completed outcome measures at baseline and at 12months (postassessment) included functional impairment, ADHD symptoms, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms, parenting behavior, and parental satisfaction with the intervention (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01660425; URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01660425).<h4>Results</h4>Intention-to-treat analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs), which controlled for baseline data, revealed significant and moderate intervention effects for ODD symptoms and negative parenting behavior at the postassessment, whereas per-protocol analyses additionally showed significant and moderate effects on functional impairment (primary outcome). Parents expressed high satisfaction with the program.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The TASH program enhances effects of methylphenidate treatment in families who complete the intervention. Thediscontinuation rate of about 30% and comparison between completing and discontinuing families suggest that the program may be more suitable for families with a higher educational level and fewer additional stresses.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

27895719,DRABAL: novel method to mine large high-throughput screening assays using Bayesian active learning.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mining high-throughput screening (HTS) assays is key for enhancing decisions in the area of drug repositioning and drug discovery. However, many challenges are encountered in the process of developing suitable and accurate methods for extracting useful information from these assays. Virtual screening and a wide variety of databases, methods and solutions proposed to-date, did not completely overcome these challenges. This study is based on a multi-label classification (MLC) technique for modeling correlations between several HTS assays, meaning that a single prediction represents a subset of assigned correlated labels instead of one label. Thus, the devised method provides an increased probability for more accurate predictions of compounds that were not tested in particular assays.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present DRABAL, a novel MLC solution that incorporates structure learning of a Bayesian network as a step to model dependency between the HTS assays. In this study, DRABAL was used to process more than 1.4 million interactions of over 400,000 compounds and analyze the existing relationships between five large HTS assays from the PubChem BioAssay Database. Compared to different MLC methods, DRABAL significantly improves the F<sub>1</sub>Score by about 22%, on average. We further illustrated usefulness and utility of DRABAL through screening FDA approved drugs and reported ones that have a high probability to interact with several targets, thus enabling drug-multi-target repositioning. Specifically DRABAL suggests the Thiabendazole drug as a common activator of the NCP1 and Rab-9A proteins, both of which are designed to identify treatment modalities for the Niemann-Pick type C disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a novel MLC solution based on a Bayesian active learning framework to overcome the challenge of lacking fully labeled training data and exploit actual dependencies between the HTS assays. The solution is motivated by the need to model dependencies between existing experimental confirmatory HTS assays and improve prediction performance. We have pursued extensive experiments over several HTS assays and have shown the advantages of DRABAL.

Here we describe the development of a Python tool that: (1) allows users to quickly view and explore microscopy data; (2) generate reproducible analyses, encoding a complete history of image transformations from raw data to final result; and (3) scale up analyses from initial exploration to high throughput processing pipelines, with a minimal amount of extra effort.

27976886,MIB: Metal Ion-Binding Site Prediction and Docking Server.,"The structure of a protein determines its biological function(s) and its interactions with other factors; the binding regions tend to be conserved in sequence and structure, and the interacting residues involved are usually in close 3D space. The Protein Data Bank currently contains more than 110000 protein structures, approximately one-third of which contain metal ions. Identifying and characterizing metal ion-binding sites is thus essential for investigating a protein's function(s) and interactions. However, experimental approaches are time-consuming and costly. The web server reported here was built to predict metal ion-binding residues and to generate the predicted metal ion-bound 3D structure. Binding templates have been constructed for regions that bind 12 types of metal ion-binding residues have been used to construct binding templates. The templates include residues within 3.5  of the metal ion, and the fragment transformation method was used for structural comparison between query proteins and templates without any data training. Through the adjustment of scoring functions, which are based on the similarity of structure and binding residues. Twelve kinds of metal ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Hg<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, and Cu<sup>+</sup>) binding residues prediction are supported.

28066963,Phenotiki: an open software and hardware platform for affordable and easy image-based phenotyping of rosette-shaped plants.,"Phenotyping is important to understand plant biology, but current solutions are costly, not versatile or are difficult to deploy. To solve this problem, we present Phenotiki, an affordable system for plant phenotyping that, relying on off-the-shelf parts, provides an easy to install and maintain platform, offering an out-of-box experience for a well-established phenotyping need: imaging rosette-shaped plants. The accompanying software (with available source code) processes data originating from our device seamlessly and automatically. Our software relies on machine learning to devise robust algorithms, and includes an automated leaf count obtained from 2D images without the need of depth (3D). Our affordable device (~200) can be deployed in growth chambers or greenhouse to acquire optical 2D images of approximately up to 60 adult Arabidopsis rosettes concurrently. Data from the device are processed remotely on a workstation or via a cloud application (based on CyVerse). In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept validation experiment on top-view images of 24 Arabidopsis plants in a combination of genotypes that has not been compared previously. Phenotypic analysis with respect to morphology, growth, color and leaf count has not been performed comprehensively before now. We confirm the findings of others on some of the extracted traits, showing that we can phenotype at reduced cost. We also perform extensive validations with external measurements and with higher fidelity equipment, and find no loss in statistical accuracy when we use the affordable setting that we propose.

28130241,Classification of RNA structure change by 'gazing' at experimental data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mutations (or Single Nucleotide Variants) in folded RiboNucleic Acid structures that cause local or global conformational change are riboSNitches. Predicting riboSNitches is challenging, as it requires making two, albeit related, structure predictions. The data most often used to experimentally validate riboSNitch predictions is Selective 2' Hydroxyl Acylation by Primer Extension, or SHAPE. Experimentally establishing a riboSNitch requires the quantitative comparison of two SHAPE traces: wild-type (WT) and mutant. Historically, SHAPE data was collected on electropherograms and change in structure was evaluated by 'gel gazing.' SHAPE data is now routinely collected with next generation sequencing and/or capillary sequencers. We aim to establish a classifier capable of simulating human 'gazing' by identifying features of the SHAPE profile that human experts agree 'looks' like a riboSNitch.<h4>Results</h4>We find strong quantitative agreement between experts when RNA scientists 'gaze' at SHAPE data and identify riboSNitches. We identify dynamic time warping and seven other features predictive of the human consensus. The classSNitch classifier reported here accurately reproduces human consensus for 167 mutant/WT comparisons with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) above 0.8. When we analyze 2019 mutant traces for 17 different RNAs, we find that features of the WT SHAPE reactivity allow us to improve thermodynamic structure predictions of riboSNitches. This is significant, as accurate RNA structural analysis and prediction is likely to become an important aspect of precision medicine.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The classSNitch R package is freely available at http://classsnitch.r-forge.r-project.org .<h4>Contact</h4>alain@email.unc.edu.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
28137292,Correcting for cell-type effects in DNA methylation studies: reference-based method outperforms latent variable approaches in empirical studies.,"Based on an extensive simulation study, McGregor and colleagues recently recommended the use of surrogate variable analysis (SVA) to control for the confounding effects of cell-type heterogeneity in DNA methylation association studies in scenarios where no cell-type proportions are available. As their recommendation was mainly based on simulated data, we sought to replicate findings in two large-scale empirical studies. In our empirical data, SVA did not fully correct for cell-type effects, its performance was somewhat unstable, and it carried a risk of missing true signals caused by removing variation that might be linked to actual disease processes. By contrast, a reference-based correction method performed well and did not show these limitations. A disadvantage of this approach is that if reference methylomes are not (publicly) available, they will need to be generated once for a small set of samples. However, given the notable risk we observed for cell-type confounding, we argue that, to avoid introducing false-positive findings into the literature, it could be well worth making this investment.Please see related Correspondence article: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10/1186/s13059-017-1149-7 and related Research article: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0935-y.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

We first downloaded a gene expression profile dataset GSE29721 (10 HCC and 10 control samples) from Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the paired t-test using limma package. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses were performed with DAVID tools. Transcription factors were annotated with TRANSFAC database and tumor associated genes (TAGs) were annotated with TAG and TSGene databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was conducted using STRING online tool and function module was further identified with BioNet package. Totally, 527 up-regulated DEGs and 587 down-regulated DEGs were identified. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the up-regulated DEGs were mainly related to cell division and cell cycle, while the down-regulated DEGs were largely related to material metabolism, especially secondary metabolism. Proteins encoded by DEGs CDK1, BUB1, CDC20, NCAPG, NDC80, CDCA8, MAD2L1, CCNB1, CCNA2 and BIRC5 were hub genes with high degrees in the PPI network; further module analysis detected a subnetwork consisting of 55 proteins, such as CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2. Taken together, aberrant expression of cell cycle related genes (e.g., CDK1, CCNA2, CCNB1, BUB1, MAD2L1 and CDC20) and material metabolism related genes (e.g., CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2) may contribute to HCC occurrence.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource
28254065,"biomechZoo: An open-source toolbox for the processing, analysis, and visualization of biomechanical movement data.","It is common for biomechanics data sets to contain numerous dependent variables recorded over time, for many subjects, groups, and/or conditions. These data often require standard sorting, processing, and analysis operations to be performed in order to answer research questions. Visualization of these data is also crucial. This manuscript presents biomechZoo, an open-source toolbox that provides tools and graphical user interfaces to help users achieve these goals. The aims of this manuscript are to (1) introduce the main features of the toolbox, including a virtual three-dimensional environment to animate motion data (Director), a data plotting suite (Ensembler), and functions for the computation of three-dimensional lower-limb joint angles, moments, and power and (2) compare these computations to those of an existing validated system. To these ends, the steps required to process and analyze a sample data set via the toolbox are outlined. The data set comprises three-dimensional marker, ground reaction force (GRF), joint kinematic, and joint kinetic data of subjects performing straight walking and 90 turning manoeuvres. Joint kinematics and kinetics processed within the toolbox were found to be similar to outputs from a commercial system. The biomechZoo toolbox represents the work of several years and multiple contributors to provide a flexible platform to examine time-series data sets typical in the movement sciences. The toolbox has previously been used to process and analyse walking, running, and ice hockey data sets, and can integrate existing routines, such as the KineMat toolbox, for additional analyses. The toolbox can help researchers and clinicians new to programming or biomechanics to process and analyze their data through a customizable workflow, while advanced users are encouraged to contribute additional functionality to the project. Students may benefit from using biomechZoo as a learning and research tool. It is hoped that the toolbox can play a role in advancing research in the movement sciences.

28263273,Hospital Administration and Nursing Leadership in Disasters: An Exploratory Study Using Concept Mapping.,"Strong leadership is critical in disaster situations when """"patient surge"""" challenges a hospital's capacity to respond and normally acceptable patterns of care are disrupted. Activation of the emergency operations plan triggers an incident command system structure for leadership decision making. Yet, implementation of the emergency operations plan and incident command system protocols is ultimately subject to nursing and hospital leadership at the service- and unit level. The results of these service-/unit-based leadership decisions have the potential to directly impact staff and patient safety, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes. Despite the critical nature of these events, nurse leaders and administrators receive little education regarding leadership and decision making during disaster events. The purpose of this study is to identify essential competencies of nursing and hospital administrators' leadership during disaster events. An integrative mixed-methods design combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to data collection and analysis was used. Five focus groups were conducted with nurse leaders and hospital administrators at a large urban hospital in the Northeastern United States in a collaborative group process to generate relevant leadership competencies. Concept Systems Incorporated was used to sort, prioritize, and analyze the data (http://conceptsystemsinc.com/). The results suggest that participants' institutional knowledge (of existing resources, communications, processes) and prior disaster experience increase leadership competence.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

28426817,Evaluation of machine learning algorithms and structural features for optimal MRI-based diagnostic prediction in psychosis.,"A relatively large number of studies have investigated the power of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data to discriminate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls. However, very few of them have also included patients with bipolar disorder, allowing the clinically relevant discrimination between both psychotic diagnostics. To assess the efficacy of sMRI data for diagnostic prediction in psychosis we objectively evaluated the discriminative power of a wide range of commonly used machine learning algorithms (ridge, lasso, elastic net and L0 norm regularized logistic regressions, a support vector classifier, regularized discriminant analysis, random forests and a Gaussian process classifier) on main sMRI features including grey and white matter voxel-based morphometry (VBM), vertex-based cortical thickness and volume, region of interest volumetric measures and wavelet-based morphometry (WBM) maps. All possible combinations of algorithms and data features were considered in pairwise classifications of matched samples of healthy controls (N = 127), patients with schizophrenia (N = 128) and patients with bipolar disorder (N = 128). Results show that the selection of feature type is important, with grey matter VBM (without data reduction) delivering the best diagnostic prediction rates (averaging over classifiers: schizophrenia vs. healthy 75%, bipolar disorder vs. healthy 63% and schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorder 62%) whereas algorithms usually yielded very similar results. Indeed, those grey matter VBM accuracy rates were not even improved by combining all feature types in a single prediction model. Further multi-class classifications considering the three groups simultaneously made evident a lack of predictive power for the bipolar group, probably due to its intermediate anatomical features, located between those observed in healthy controls and those found in patients with schizophrenia. Finally, we provide MRIPredict (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mripredict/), a free tool for SPM, FSL and R, to easily carry out voxelwise predictions based on VBM images.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
28444590,Transcripts of pectin-degrading enzymes and isolation of complete cDNA sequence of a pectate lyase gene induced by coffee white stem borer (Xylotrechus quadripes) in the bark tissue of Coffea canephora (robusta coffee).,"Of the two commercially cultivated coffee (Coffea) species, C. arabica (arabica) is highly susceptible and C. canephora (robusta) is highly resistant to the insect pest Xylotrechus quadripes (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), commonly known as coffee white stem borer (CWSB). We constructed a forward-subtracted cDNA library by Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) from robusta bark tissue for profiling genes induced by CWSB infestation. Among the 265 unigenes of the SSH EST library, 7 unigenes (5 contigs and 2 singletons) matching different pectin-degrading enzymes were discovered. These ESTs matched one pectate lyase, three polygalacturonases, and one pectin acetylesterase gene. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that CWSB infestation strongly induces the pectate lyase gene at 72h. Complete cDNA sequence of the pectate lyase gene was obtained through 3' and 5' RACE reactions. It was a 1595bp long sequence that included full CDS and both UTRs. Against C. canephora genome sequences in Coffee Genome Hub database ( http://coffee-genome.org/ ), it had 22 matches to different pectate lyase genes mapped on 9 of the 11 pseudochromosomes, the top match being Cc07_g00190 Pectate lyase. In NCBI database, it matched pectate lyase sequences of several plants. Apart from C. canephora, the closest pectate lyase matches were from Sesamum indicum and Nicotiana tabacum. The pectinolytic enzymes discovered here are thought to play a role in the production of oligogalacturonides (OGs) which act as Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) signals eliciting innate immunity in plants. The pectate lyase gene, induced by CWSB infestation, along with other endogenous pectinolytic enzymes and CWSB-specific elicitors, may be involved in triggering basal defense responses to protect the CWSB-damaged tissue against pathogens, as well as to contain CWSB in robusta.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

28453624,Inferring Rates and Length-Distributions of Indels Using Approximate Bayesian Computation.,"The most common evolutionary events at the molecular level are single-base substitutions, as well as insertions and deletions (indels) of short DNA segments. A large body of research has been devoted to develop probabilistic substitution models and to infer their parameters using likelihood and Bayesian approaches. In contrast, relatively little has been done to model indel dynamics, probably due to the difficulty in writing explicit likelihood functions. Here, we contribute to the effort of modeling indel dynamics by presenting SpartaABC, an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach to infer indel parameters from sequence data (either aligned or unaligned). SpartaABC circumvents the need to use an explicit likelihood function by extracting summary statistics from simulated sequences. First, summary statistics are extracted from the input sequence data. Second, SpartaABC samples indel parameters from a prior distribution and uses them to simulate sequences. Third, it computes summary statistics from the simulated sets of sequences. By computing a distance between the summary statistics extracted from the input and each simulation, SpartaABC can provide an approximation to the posterior distribution of indel parameters as well as point estimates. We study the performance of our methodology and show that it provides accurate estimates of indel parameters in simulations. We next demonstrate the utility of SpartaABC by studying the impact of alignment errors on the inference of positive selection.

28462382,GATA4 Is Sufficient to Establish Jejunal Versus Ileal Identity in the Small Intestine.,"<h4>Background & aims</h4>Patterning of the small intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis establishes three functionally distinct regions: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Efficient nutrient assimilation and growth depend on the proper spatial patterning of specialized digestive and absorptive functions performed by duodenal, jejunal, and ileal enterocytes. When enterocyte function is disrupted by disease or injury, intestinal failure can occur. One approach to alleviate intestinal failure would be to restore lost enterocyte functions. The molecular mechanisms determining regionally defined enterocyte functions, however, are poorly delineated. We previously showed that GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) is essential to define jejunal enterocytes. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that GATA4 is sufficient to confer jejunal identity within the intestinal epithelium.<h4>Methods</h4>To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel <i>Gata4</i> conditional knock-in mouse line and expressed GATA4 in the ileum, where it is absent.<h4>Results</h4>We found that GATA4-expressing ileum lost ileal identity. The global gene expression profile of GATA4-expressing ileal epithelium aligned more closely with jejunum and duodenum rather than ileum. Focusing on jejunal vs ileal identity, we defined sets of jejunal and ileal genes likely to be regulated directly by GATA4 to suppress ileal identity and promote jejunal identity. Furthermore, our study implicates GATA4 as a transcriptional repressor of <i>fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15)</i>, which encodes an enterokine that has been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, this study refines our understanding of an important GATA4-dependent molecular mechanism to pattern the intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis by elaborating on GATA4's function as a crucial dominant molecular determinant of jejunal enterocyte identity.

28472263,A deep learning framework for improving long-range residue-residue contact prediction using a hierarchical strategy.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Residue-residue contacts are of great value for protein structure prediction, since contact information, especially from those long-range residue pairs, can significantly reduce the complexity of conformational sampling for protein structure prediction in practice. Despite progresses in the past decade on protein targets with abundant homologous sequences, accurate contact prediction for proteins with limited sequence information is still far from satisfaction. Methodologies for these hard targets still need further improvement.<h4>Results</h4>We presented a computational program DeepConPred, which includes a pipeline of two novel deep-learning-based methods (DeepCCon and DeepRCon) as well as a contact refinement step, to improve the prediction of long-range residue contacts from primary sequences. When compared with previous prediction approaches, our framework employed an effective scheme to identify optimal and important features for contact prediction, and was only trained with coevolutionary information derived from a limited number of homologous sequences to ensure robustness and usefulness for hard targets. Independent tests showed that 59.33%/49.97%, 64.39%/54.01% and 70.00%/59.81% of the top L/5, top L/10 and top 5 predictions were correct for CASP10/CASP11 proteins, respectively. In general, our algorithm ranked as one of the best methods for CASP targets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All source data and codes are available at http://166.111.152.91/Downloads.html .<h4>Contact</h4>hgong@tsinghua.edu.cn or zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
28490512,Preconceptional and gestational weight trajectories and risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age baby in rural Gambia.,"<b>Background:</b> Maternal nutritional status is a key determinant of small for gestational age (SGA), but some knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding the role of the energy balance entering pregnancy.<b>Objective:</b> We investigated how preconceptional and gestational weight trajectories (summarized by individual-level traits) are associated with SGA risk in rural Gambia.<b>Design:</b> The sample comprised 670 women in a trial with serial weight data (7310 observations) that were available before and during pregnancy. Individual trajectories from 6 mo before conception to 30 wk of gestation were produced with the use of multilevel modeling. Summary traits were expressed as weight <i>z</i> scores [weight <i>z</i> score at 3 mo preconception (<i>z</i>wt<sub>-3 mo</sub>), weight <i>z</i> score at conception, weight <i>z</i> score at 3 mo postconception, weight <i>z</i> score at 7 mo postconception (<i>z</i>wt<sub>+7 mo</sub>), and conditional measures that represented the change from the preceding time] and were related to SGA risk with the use of Poisson regression with confounder adjustment; linear splines were used to account for nonlinearity.<b>Results:</b> Maternal weight at each time point had a consistent nonlinear relation with SGA risk. For example, the <i>z</i>wt<sub>-3 mo</sub> estimate was stronger in women with values =0.5 (RR: 0.736; 95% CI: 0.594, 0.910) than in women with values >0.5 (RR: 0.920; 95% CI: 0.682, 1.241). The former group had the highest observed SGA prevalence. Focusing on weight change, only conditional <i>z</i>wt<sub>+7 mo</sub> was associated with SGA and only in women with values >-0.5 (RR: 0.579; 95% CI: 0.463, 0.724).<b>Conclusions:</b> Protection against delivering an SGA neonate offered by greater preconceptional or gestational weight may be most pronounced in more undernourished and vulnerable women. Independent of this possibility, greater second- and third-trimester weight gain beyond a threshold may be protective.

28530006,Kindergarten/Elementary School Teachers and Web-based Oral Health-Related Resources: An Exploration.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The percentage of U.S. children with poor oral health continues to be high. Kindergarten/elementary school educators could play an important role in teaching students about oral health promotion. The objectives were to assess which oral health-related web-based resources teachers consider most helpful and how teachers' attitudes, knowledge, and behavioural intentions concerning oral health-related teaching change between before and after having access to a resource website.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Web-based survey data were collected from 95 kindergarten/elementary school educators before and after they accessed a website with oral health-related information for teachers (web-link: http://media.dent.umich.edu/teachoralhealth/index.html).<h4>Results</h4>Most teachers accessed lesson plans about 'Teeth and smiling' (90%) and 'Taking care of your teeth' (88%) and the fewest accessed information about 'Nutrition and health' (42%) and 'Information for parents' (39%). On average, all materials were perceived as useful (5-point scale with 5='very useful', range=3.80 to 4.04). Responses to the question on how important dental health is for a child's ability to learn improved significantly from before to after the educational intervention (5-point scale with 5='very important', 3.78 vs 4.44). Knowledge increased and behavioural intentions improved as well. The percentage of teachers who reported that they had included oral health-related material in the past was 47% and the percentage who intended to include it in the future was 65% (p<0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Providing kindergarten/elementary school educators with web-based resource materials improves their attitudes, increases their knowledge and leads to positive behavioural intentions concerning educating their students about oral health.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
28537071,CLMSVault: A Software Suite for Protein Cross-Linking Mass-Spectrometry Data Analysis and Visualization.,"Protein cross-linking mass spectrometry (CL-MS) enables the sensitive detection of protein interactions and the inference of protein complex topology. The detection of chemical cross-links between protein residues can identify intra- and interprotein contact sites or provide physical constraints for molecular modeling of protein structure. Recent innovations in cross-linker design, sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and software tools have significantly improved CL-MS approaches. Although a number of algorithms now exist for the identification of cross-linked peptides from mass spectral data, a dearth of user-friendly analysis tools represent a practical bottleneck to the broad adoption of the approach. To facilitate the analysis of CL-MS data, we developed CLMSVault, a software suite designed to leverage existing CL-MS algorithms and provide intuitive and flexible tools for cross-platform data interpretation. CLMSVault stores and combines complementary information obtained from different cross-linkers and search algorithms. CLMSVault provides filtering, comparison, and visualization tools to support CL-MS analyses and includes a workflow for label-free quantification of cross-linked peptides. An embedded 3D viewer enables the visualization of quantitative data and the mapping of cross-linked sites onto PDB structural models. We demonstrate the application of CLMSVault for the analysis of a noncovalent Cdc34-ubiquitin protein complex cross-linked under different conditions. CLMSVault is open-source software (available at https://gitlab.com/courcelm/clmsvault.git ), and a live demo is available at http://democlmsvault.tyerslab.com/ .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
28579402,MIDAS: Mining differentially activated subpaths of KEGG pathways from multi-class RNA-seq data.,"Pathway based analysis of high throughput transcriptome data is a widely used approach to investigate biological mechanisms. Since a pathway consists of multiple functions, the recent approach is to determine condition specific sub-pathways or subpaths. However, there are several challenges. First, few existing methods utilize explicit gene expression information from RNA-seq. More importantly, subpath activity is usually an average of statistical scores, e.g., correlations, of edges in a candidate subpath, which fails to reflect gene expression quantity information. In addition, none of existing methods can handle multiple phenotypes. To address these technical problems, we designed and implemented an algorithm, MIDAS, that determines condition specific subpaths, each of which has different activities across multiple phenotypes. MIDAS utilizes gene expression quantity information fully and the network centrality information to determine condition specific subpaths. To test performance of our tool, we used TCGA breast cancer RNA-seq gene expression profiles with five molecular subtypes. 36 differentially activate subpaths were determined. The utility of our method, MIDAS, was demonstrated in four ways. All 36 subpaths are well supported by the literature information. Subsequently, we showed that these subpaths had a good discriminant power for five cancer subtype classification and also had a prognostic power in terms of survival analysis. Finally, in a performance comparison of MIDAS to a recent subpath prediction method, PATHOME, our method identified more subpaths and much more genes that are well supported by the literature information.<h4>Availability</h4>http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/MIDAS/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Cost-utility analyses provide information on the relative value of different screening options. The aim of this project was to develop an open access risk assessment and cost-utility analysis web-tool for assessing HIV, HCV and HBV screening options (http://www.isbtweb.org/working-parties/transfusion-transmitted-infectious-diseases/). An analysis for six countries (Brazil, Ghana, the Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand and USA) was conducted.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Four strategies; (1) antibody assays (Abs) for HIV and HCV + HBsAg, (2) antibody assays that include antigens for HIV and HCV (Combo) + HBsAg, (3) NAT in minipools of variable size (MP NAT) and (4) individual donation (ID) NAT can be evaluated using the tool. Country-specific data on donors, donation testing results, recipient outcomes and costs are entered using the online interface. Results obtained include the number infections interdicted using each screening options, and the (incremental and average) cost-utility of the options.<h4>Results</h4>In each of the six countries evaluated, the use of antibody assays is cost effective or even cost saving. NAT has varying cost-utility depending on the setting, and where adopted, the incremental cost-utility exceeds any previously defined or proposed threshold in each country.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The web-tool allows an assessment of infectious units interdicted and value for money of different testing strategies. Regardless of gross national income (GNI) per capita, countries appear willing to dedicate healthcare resources to blood supply safety in excess of that for other sectors of health care.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Endoparasitic specimens of E. nigrocorallium were found associated with three species of antipatharians on the Great Reef of Toliara. Individuals inhabit the gastrovascular ducts of their hosts and evidence of infestation is, most of the time, not visible externally. Phylogenetic analyses based on 18S rDNA, 16S rDNA and COI data indicate a close relation to Eenymeenymyzostoma cirripedium, the only other species of the genus. The morphology of E. nigrocorallium is very unusual compared to that of the more conventional E. cirripedium. The new species has five pairs of extremely reduced parapodia located on the body margin and no introvert, cirri or lateral organs. Individuals are hermaphroditic, with the male and female gonads both being located dorsally in the trunk. It also has a highly developed parenchymo-muscular layer on the ventral side, and the digestive system lies in the middle part of the trunk.

28698795,Semi-automated Modular Program Constructor for physiological modeling: Building cell and organ models.,"The Modular Program Constructor (MPC) is an open-source Java based modeling utility, built upon JSim's Mathematical Modeling Language (MML) ( http://www.physiome.org/jsim/) that uses directives embedded in model code to construct larger, more complicated models quickly and with less error than manually combining models. A major obstacle in writing complex models for physiological processes is the large amount of time it takes to model the myriad processes taking place simultaneously in cells, tissues, and organs. MPC replaces this task with code-generating algorithms that take model code from several different existing models and produce model code for a new JSim model. This is particularly useful during multi-scale model development where many variants are to be configured and tested against data. MPC encodes and preserves information about how a model is built from its simpler model modules, allowing the researcher to quickly substitute or update modules for hypothesis testing.

28711973,PIWI-interacting RNAs as novel regulators of pancreatic beta cell function.,"<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>P-element induced Wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that interact with PIWI proteins and guide them to silence transposable elements. They are abundantly expressed in germline cells and play key roles in spermatogenesis. There is mounting evidence that piRNAs are also present in somatic cells, where they may accomplish additional regulatory tasks. The aim of this study was to identify the piRNAs expressed in pancreatic islets and to determine whether they are involved in the control of beta cell activities.<h4>Methods</h4>piRNA profiling of rat pancreatic islets was performed by microarray analysis. The functions of piRNAs were investigated by silencing the two main Piwi genes or by modulating the level of selected piRNAs in islet cells.<h4>Results</h4>We detected about 18,000 piRNAs in rat pancreatic islets, many of which were differentially expressed throughout islet postnatal development. Moreover, we identified changes in the level of several piRNAs in the islets of Goto-Kakizaki rats, a well-established animal model of type 2 diabetes. Silencing of Piwil2 or Piwil4 genes in adult rat islets caused a reduction in the level of several piRNAs and resulted in defective insulin secretion and increased resistance of the cells to cytokine-induced cell death. Furthermore, overexpression in the islets of control animals of two piRNAs that are upregulated in diabetic rats led to a selective defect in glucose-induced insulin release.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our results provide evidence for a role of PIWI proteins and their associated piRNAs in the control of beta cell functions, and suggest a possible involvement in the development of type 2 diabetes.<h4>Data availability</h4>Data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus repository under the accession number GSE93792.

Here we present PECAN (http://pecan.maccosslab.org), a library-free, peptide-centric tool that robustly and accurately detects peptides directly from DIA data. PECAN reports evidence of detection based on product ion scoring, which enables detection of low-abundance analytes with poor precursor ion signal. We demonstrate the chromatographic peak picking accuracy and peptide detection capability of PECAN, and we further validate its detection with data-dependent acquisition and targeted analyses.

28787666,ERas is constitutively expressed in full term placenta of pregnant cows.,"ERas is a new gene recently found in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and localized on the X chromosome. It plays a role in mouse ES cell survival and is constitutively active without any mutations. It was also found to be responsible for the maintenance of quiescence of the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), liver-resident mesenchymal stem cells, the activation of which results in liver fibrosis. This gene was not present in human ES cells. ERas was found to be activated in a significant population of human gastric cancer, where ERAS may play a crucial role in gastric cancer cell survival and metastases to liver via down-regulation of E-cadherin. ERas gene has been found to be expressed both in ES cells and adult tissues of cynomolgus monkey. Cynomolgus ERAS did not promote cell proliferation or induce tumor formation. ERAS was also detected in normal and neoplastic urothelium of the urinary bladder in cattle, where bovine ERAS formed a constitutive complex with platelet derived growth factor  receptor (PDGFR) resulting in the activation of AKT signaling. Here, molecular and morphological findings of ERAS in the full term placenta of pregnant cows have been investigated for the first time. ERAS was studied by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Alignment of the sequence detects a 100% identity with all transcript variant bovine ERas mRNAs, present in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Furthermore, ERAS was detected by Western blot and investigated by real time PCR that revealed an amount of ERAS more than ERAS found in normal bovine urothelium but less than ERAS present in the liver. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of ERAS protein both at the level of plasma membrane and in cytoplasm of epithelial cells lining caruncular crypts and in trophoblasts of villi. An evident ERAS immunoreactivity was also seen throughout the chorionic and uterine gland epithelium. Although this is not a functional study and further investigations will be warranted, it is conceivable that ERAS may have pleiotropic effects in the placenta, some of which, like normal urothelial cells, might lead to activation of AKT pathway. We speculate that ERAS may play a key role in cellular processes such as cell differentiation and movement. Accordingly, we believe it may be an important factor involved in trophoblast invasiveness via AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, ERas gene is a functional gene which contributes to homeostasis of bovine placenta.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource
28812439,Evaluating disease prediction models using a cohort whose covariate distribution differs from that of the target population.,"Personal predictive models for disease development play important roles in chronic disease prevention. The performance of these models is evaluated by applying them to the baseline covariates of participants in external cohort studies, with model predictions compared to subjects' subsequent disease incidence. However, the covariate distribution among participants in a validation cohort may differ from that of the population for which the model will be used. Since estimates of predictive model performance depend on the distribution of covariates among the subjects to which it is applied, such differences can cause misleading estimates of model performance in the target population. We propose a method for addressing this problem by weighting the cohort subjects to make their covariate distribution better match that of the target population. Simulations show that the method provides accurate estimates of model performance in the target population, while un-weighted estimates may not. We illustrate the method by applying it to evaluate an ovarian cancer prediction model targeted to US women, using cohort data from participants in the California Teachers Study.

However, from a researcher's point of view, it is difficult to determine whether efforts to make work more visible are worthwhile (in terms of the association with publication metrics) and within that, difficult to assess which platform or network is most effective for sharing work and connecting to a wider audience. We undertook a case study of Kudos (https://www.growkudos.com), a web-based service that claims to help researchers increase the outreach of their publications, to examine the most effective tools for sharing publications online, and to investigate which actions are associated with improved metrics. We extracted a dataset from Kudos of 830,565 unique publications claimed by authors, for which 20,775 had actions taken to explain or share via Kudos, and for 4,867 of these full text download data from publishers was available. Findings show that researchers are most likely to share their work on Facebook, but links shared on Twitter are more likely to be clicked on. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that a treatment group (publications having actions in Kudos) had a significantly higher median average of 149 full text downloads (23.1% more) per publication as compared to a control group (having no actions in Kudos) with a median average of 121 full text downloads per publication. These findings suggest that performing actions on publications, such as sharing, explaining, or enriching, could help to increase the number of full text downloads of a publication.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not about the resource

Our goal was to evaluate the potential for causal inference from the studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified 14 studies on the topic (distinct by region, time period and/or population). We evaluated each study with regard to modeling approaches, potential biases, and the strength of evidence. We also considered consistencies and differences in the collective results.<h4>Discussion</h4>Positive associations between drinking-water turbidity and AGI incidence were found in different cities and time periods, and with both unfiltered and filtered supplies. There was some evidence for a stronger association at higher turbidity levels. The studies appeared to adequately adjust for confounding. There was fair consistency in the notable lags between turbidity measurement and AGI identification, which fell between 6 and 10 d in many studies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The observed associations suggest a detectable incidence of waterborne AGI from drinking water in the systems and time periods studied. However, some discrepant results indicate that the association may be context specific. Combining turbidity with seasonal and climatic factors, additional water quality measures, and treatment data may enhance predictive modeling in future studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1090.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
28918286,Identifying combinatorial biomarkers by association rule mining in the CAMD Alzheimer's database.,"The concept of combinatorial biomarkers was conceived when it was noticed that simple biomarkers are often inadequate for recognizing and characterizing complex diseases. Here we present an algorithmic search method for complex biomarkers which may predict or indicate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other kinds of dementia. We show that our method is universal since it can describe any Boolean function for biomarker discovery. We applied data mining techniques that are capable to uncover implication-like logical schemes with detailed quality scoring. The new SCARF program was applied for the Tucson, Arizona based Critical Path Institute's CAMD database, containing laboratory and cognitive test data for 5821 patients from the placebo arm of clinical trials of large pharmaceutical companies, and consequently, the data is much more reliable than numerous other databases for dementia. The results of our study on this larger than 5800-patient cohort suggest beneficial effects of high B12 vitamin level, negative effects of high sodium levels or high AST (aspartate aminotransferase) liver enzyme levels to cognition. As an example for a more complex and quite surprising rule: Low or normal blood glucose level with either low cholesterol or high serum sodium would also increase the probability of bad cognition with a 3.7 multiplier.

We have investigated the in vivo pharmacology of a novel buprenorphine analogue, BU10119, for the first time.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>To determine the opioid pharmacology of BU10119 (0.3-3mgkg<sup>-1</sup> , i.p.) in vivo, the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay was applied in adult male CD1 mice. A range of behavioural paradigms was used to investigate the locomotor effects, rewarding properties and antidepressant or anxiolytic potential of BU10119. Additional groups of mice were exposed to a single (1נ2h) or repeated restraint stress (3 daily 2h) to determine the ability of BU10119 to block stress-induced analgesia.<h4>Key results</h4>BU10119 alone was without any antinociceptive activity. BU10119 (1mgkg<sup>-1</sup> ) was able to block U50,488, buprenorphine and morphine-induced antinociception. The <U+03BA> antagonist effects of BU10119 in the tail-withdrawal assay reversed between 24 and 48h. BU10119 was without significant locomotor or rewarding effects. BU10119 (1mgkg<sup>-1</sup> ) significantly reduced the latency to feed in the novelty-induced hypophagia task and reduced immobility time in the forced swim test, compared to saline-treated animals. There were no significant effects of BU10119 in either the elevated plus maze or the light-dark box. Both acute and repeated restraint stress-induced analgesia were blocked by pretreatment with BU10119 (1mgkg<sup>-1</sup> ). Parallel stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone were not affected.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>BU10119 is a mixed <U+03BA>/ receptor antagonist with relatively short-duration <U+03BA> antagonist activity. Based on these preclinical data, BU10119 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of depression and other stress-induced conditions.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Emerging Areas of Opioid Pharmacology.

28974379,Structural-functional diversity of the natural oligopeptides.,"Natural oligopeptides may regulate nearly all vital processes. To date, the chemical structures of many oligopeptides have been identified from >2000 organisms representing all the biological kingdoms. Wehave considered a number of mathematical (sequence length), chemical, physical, and biological featuresof an array of natural oligopeptides on the basis of the oligopeptide EROP-Moscow database (http://erop.inbi.ras.ru, 15,351 entries) data. There is the substantial difference of these substances from polypeptide molecules of proteins according to their physicochemical characteristics. These characteristics may be critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the action of oligopeptides that lead to the development of physiological effects.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not about the resource
28981577,'Multi-omic' data analysis using O-miner.,"Innovations in -omics technologies have driven advances in biomedical research. However, integrating and analysing the large volumes of data generated from different high-throughput -omics technologies remain a significant challenge to basic and clinical scientists without bioinformatics skills or access to bioinformatics support. To address this demand, we have significantly updated our previous O-miner analytical suite, to incorporate several new features and data types to provide an efficient and easy-to-use Web tool for the automated analysis of data from '-omics' technologies. Created from a biologist's perspective, this tool allows for the automated analysis of large and complex transcriptomic, genomic and methylomic data sets, together with biological/clinical information, to identify significantly altered pathways and prioritize novel biomarkers/targets for biological validation. Our resource can be used to analyse both in-house data and the huge amount of publicly available information from array and sequencing platforms. Multiple data sets can be easily combined, allowing for meta-analyses. Here, we describe the analytical pipelines currently available in O-miner and present examples of use to demonstrate its utility and relevance in maximizing research output.

28985876,The readability of psychosocial wellness patient resources: improving surgical outcomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Patient education is increasingly accessed with online resources and is essential for patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes. The average American adult reads at a seventh grade level, and the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the American Medical Association (AMA) recommend that information be written at a sixth-grade reading level. Health literacy plays an important role in the disease course and outcomes of all patients, including those with depression and likely other psychiatric disorders, although this is an area in need of further study. The purpose of this study was to collect and analyze written, online mental health resources on the Veterans Health Administration (VA) website, and other websites, using readability assessment instruments.<h4>Methods</h4>An internet search was performed to identify written patient education information regarding mental health from the VA (the VA Mental Health Website) and top-rated psychiatric hospitals. Seven mental health topics were included in the analysis: generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and suicide. Readability analyses were performed using the Gunning Fog Index, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the Coleman-Liau Index, the SMOG Readability Formula, and the Automated Readability Index. These scores were then combined into a Readability Consensus score. A two-tailed t-test was used to compare the mean values, and statistical significance was set at P<0.05.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve of the best hospitals for psychiatry 2016-2017 were identified. Nine had educational material. Six of the nine cited the same resource, The StayWell Company, LLC (StayWell Company, LLC; Yardley, PA), for at least one of the mental health topics analyzed. The VA mental health website (http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov) had a significantly higher readability consensus than six of the top psychiatric hospitals (P<0.05, P=0.0067, P=0.019, P=0.041, P=0.0093, P=0.0054, and P=0.0093). The overall average readability consensus for mental health information on all websites analyzed was 9.52.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Online resources for mental health disorders are more complex than recommended by the NIH and AMA. Efforts to improve readability of mental health and psychosocial wellness resources could benefit patient understanding and outcomes, especially in patients with lower literacy. Surgical outcomes are correlated with patient mental health and psychosocial wellness and thus can be improved with more appropriate levels of readability of psychosocial wellness resources.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

29028266,CircPro: an integrated tool for the identification of circRNAs with protein-coding potential.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>CircPro is available at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/CircPro.<h4>Contact</h4>mchen@zju.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

29036270,On expert curation and scalability: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as a case study.,"Motivation:Biological knowledgebases, such as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, constitute an essential component of daily scientific research by offering distilled, summarized and computable knowledge extracted from the literature by expert curators. While knowledgebases play an increasingly important role in the scientific community, their ability to keep up with the growth of biomedical literature is under scrutiny. Using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as a case study, we address this concern via multiple literature triage approaches. Results:With the assistance of the PubTator text-mining tool, we tagged more than 10 000 articles to assess the ratio of papers relevant for curation. We first show that curators read and evaluate many more papers than they curate, and that measuring the number of curated publications is insufficient to provide a complete picture as demonstrated by the fact that 8000-10 000 papers are curated in UniProt each year while curators evaluate 50 000-70 000 papers per year. We show that 90% of the papers in PubMed are out of the scope of UniProt, that a maximum of 2-3% of the papers indexed in PubMed each year are relevant for UniProt curation, and that, despite appearances, expert curation in UniProt is scalable.

29043042,feedr and animalnexus.ca: A paired R package and user-friendly Web application for transforming and visualizing animal movement data from static stations.,"Radio frequency identification (RFID) provides a simple and inexpensive approach for examining the movements of tagged animals, which can provide information on species behavior and ecology, such as habitat/resource use and social interactions. In addition, tracking animal movements is appealing to naturalists, citizen scientists, and the general public and thus represents a tool for public engagement in science and science education. Although a useful tool, the large amount of data collected using RFID may quickly become overwhelming. Here, we present an R package (feedr) we have developed for loading, transforming, and visualizing time-stamped, georeferenced data, such as RFID data collected from static logger stations. Using our package, data can be transformed from raw RFID data to visits, presence (regular detections by a logger over time), movements between loggers, displacements, and activity patterns. In addition, we provide several conversion functions to allow users to format data for use in functions from other complementary R packages. Data can also be visualized through static or interactive maps or as animations over time. To increase accessibility, data can be transformed and visualized either through R directly, or through the companion site: http://animalnexus.ca, an online, user-friendly, R-based Shiny Web application. This system can be used by professional and citizen scientists alike to view and study animal movements. We have designed this package to be flexible and to be able to handle data collected from other stationary sources (e.g., hair traps, static very high frequency (VHF) telemetry loggers, observations of marked individuals in colonies or staging sites), and we hope this framework will become a meeting point for science, education, and community awareness of the movements of animals. We aim to inspire citizen engagement while simultaneously enabling robust scientific analysis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

29149877,Key bottlenecks to the provision of safe obstetric anaesthesia in low- income countries; a cross-sectional survey of 64 hospitals in Uganda.,"<h4>Background</h4>Despite recent advances in surgery and anaesthesia which significantly improve safety, many health facilities in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain chronically under-resourced with inability to cope effectively with serious obstetric complications (Knight et al., PLoS One 8:e63846, 2013). As a result many of these countries still have unacceptably high maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Recent data at the national referral hospitals in East Africa reported that none of the national referral hospitals met the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists (WFSA) international standards required to provide safe obstetric anaesthesia (Epiu I: Challenges of Anesthesia in Low-and Middle-Income Countries. WFSA; 2014 http://wfsa.newsweaver.com/Newsletter/p8c8ta4ri7a1wsacct9y3u?a=2&p=47730565&t=27996496 ). In spite of this evidence, factors contributing to maternal mortality related to anaesthesia in LMICs and the magnitude of these issues have not been comprehensively studied. We therefore set out to assess regional referral, district, private for profit and private not-for profit hospitals in Uganda.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional survey at 64 government and private hospitals in Uganda using pre-set questionnaires to the anaesthetists and hospital directors. Access to the minimum requirements for safe obstetric anaesthesia according to WFSA guidelines were also checked using a checklist for operating and recovery rooms.<h4>Results</h4>Response rate was 100% following personal interviews of anaesthetists, and hospital directors. Only 3 of the 64 (5%) of the hospitals had all requirements available to meet the WFSA International guidelines for safe anaesthesia. Additionally, 54/64 (84%) did not have a trained physician anaesthetist and 5/64 (8%) had no trained providers for anaesthesia at all. Frequent shortages of drugs were reported for regional/neuroaxial anaesthesia, and other essential drugs were often lacking such as antacids and antihypertensives. We noted that many of the anaesthesia machines present were obsolete models without functional safety alarms and/or mechanical ventilators. Continuous ECG was only available in 3/64 (5%) of hospitals.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We conclude that there is a significant lack of essential equipment for the delivery of safe anaesthesia across this region. This is compounded by the shortage of trained providers and inadequate supervision. It is therefore essential to strengthen anaesthesia services by addressing these specific deficiencies. This will include improved training of associate clinicians, training more physician anaesthetists and providing the basic equipment required to provide safe and effective care. These services are key components of comprehensive emergency obstetric care and anaesthetists are crucial in managing critically ill mothers and ensuring good surgical outcomes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
29162558,Surgical Interventions for the Treatment of Supracondylar Humerus Fractures in Children: Protocol of a Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND:The treatment of supracondylar humerus fracture in children (SHFC) is associated with complications such as functional deficit, residual deformity, and iatrogenic neurological damage. The standard treatment is closed reduction and percutaneous Kirschner wire fixation with different configurations. Despite this fact, there is still no consensus on the most effective technique for the treatment of these fractures. OBJECTIVE:The aim of this systematic review will be to evaluate the effect of surgical interventions on the treatment of Gartland type II and III SHFC by assessing function, complications, and error as primary outcomes. Clinical outcomes such as range of motion and pain and radiographic outcomes will also be judged. METHODS:A systematic review of randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating the surgical treatment of SHFC will be carried out in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Cincias da Sade, and Excerpta Medica Database. The search will also occur at ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in selected databases. Data management and extraction will be performed using a data withdrawal form and by analyzing the following: study method characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention characteristics, results, methodological domains, and risk of bias. To assess the risk of bias of the included trials, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool will be used. Dichotomous outcome data will be analyzed as risk ratios, and continuous outcome data will be expressed as mean differences, both with 95% confidence intervals. Also, whenever possible, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and assessment of heterogeneity will be performed. RESULTS:Following the publication of this protocol, searches will be run and included studies will be deeply analyzed. We hope to obtain final results in the next few months and have the final paper published by the end of 2018. This study was funded by a government-based noncommercial agency, Fundao de Amparo  Pesquisa do Estado de So Paulo (FAPESP). CONCLUSIONS:This study may provide surgical treatment effects evidence for SHFC. The results will assist clinical practice by demonstrating the effectiveness and potential complications of these interventions and might serve as a reference for future clinical trials on the topic.

29168754,A Bioinformatic Pipeline for Monitoring of the Mutational Stability of Viral Drug Targets with Deep-Sequencing Technology.,"The efficient development of antiviral drugs, including efficient antiviral small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), requires continuous monitoring of the strict correspondence between a drug and the related highly variable viral DNA/RNA target(s). Deep sequencing is able to provide an assessment of both the general target conservation and the frequency of particular mutations in the different target sites. The aim of this study was to develop a reliable bioinformatic pipeline for the analysis of millions of short, deep sequencing reads corresponding to selected highly variable viral sequences that are drug target(s). The suggested bioinformatic pipeline combines the available programs and the ad hoc scripts based on an original algorithm of the search for the conserved targets in the deep sequencing data. We also present the statistical criteria for the threshold of reliable mutation detection and for the assessment of variations between corresponding data sets. These criteria are robust against the possible sequencing errors in the reads. As an example, the bioinformatic pipeline is applied to the study of the conservation of RNA interference (RNAi) targets in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) subtype A. The developed pipeline is freely available to download at the website http://virmut.eimb.ru/.

29178193,Proteomic Characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans Larval Development.,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is widely used as a model organism to study cell and developmental biology. Quantitative proteomics of C. elegans is still in its infancy and, so far, most studies have been performed on adult worm samples. Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize protein level changes across the four larval developmental stages (L1-L4) of C. elegans. In total, we identified 4130 proteins, and quantified 1541 proteins that were present across all four stages in three biological replicates from independent experiments. Using hierarchical clustering and functional ontological analyses, we identified 21 clusters containing proteins with similar protein profiles across the four stages, and highlighted the most overrepresented biological functions in each of these protein clusters. In addition, we used the dataset to identify putative larval stage-specific proteins in each individual developmental stage, as well as in the early and late developmental stages. In summary, this dataset provides system-wide analysis of protein level changes across the four C. elegans larval developmental stages, which serves as a useful resource for the C. elegans research community.

29202050,One Size Doesn't Fit All: Measuring Individual Privacy in Aggregate Genomic Data.,"Even in the aggregate, genomic data can reveal sensitive information about individuals. We present a new model-based measure, PrivMAF, that provides provable privacy guarantees for aggregate data (namely minor allele frequencies) obtained from genomic studies. Unlike many previous measures that have been designed to measure the total privacy lost by all participants in a study, PrivMAF gives an individual privacy measure for each participant in the study, not just an average measure. These individual measures can then be combined to measure the worst case privacy loss in the study. Our measure also allows us to quantify the privacy gains achieved by perturbing the data, either by adding noise or binning. Our findings demonstrate that both perturbation approaches offer significant privacy gains. Moreover, we see that these privacy gains can be achieved while minimizing perturbation (and thus maximizing the utility) relative to stricter notions of privacy, such as differential privacy. We test PrivMAF using genotype data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, providing a more nuanced understanding of the privacy risks involved in an actual genome-wide association studies. Interestingly, our analysis demonstrates that the privacy implications of releasing MAFs from a study can differ greatly from individual to individual. An implementation of our method is available at http://privmaf.csail.mit.edu.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
29224730,A validated calculator to estimate risk of cesarean after an induction of labor with an unfavorable cervix.,"<h4>Background</h4>Induction of labor occurs in >20% of pregnancies, which equates to approximately 1 million women undergoing an induction in the United States annually. Regardless of how common inductions are, our ability to predict induction success is limited. Although multiple risk factors for a failed induction have been identified, risk factors alone are not enough to quantify an actual risk of cesarean for an individual woman undergoing a cesarean.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study was to derive and validate a prediction model for cesarean after induction with an unfavorable cervix and to create a Web-based calculator to assist in patient counseling.<h4>Study design</h4>Derivation and validation of a prediction model for cesarean delivery after induction was performed as part of a planned secondary analysis of a large randomized trial. A predictive model for cesarean delivery was derived using multivariable logistic regression from a large randomized trial on induction methods (n= 491) that took place from 2013 through 2015 at an academic institution. Full-term (=37 weeks) women carrying a singleton gestation with intact membranes and an unfavorable cervix (Bishop score =6 and dilation =2 cm) undergoing an induction were included in this trial. Both nulliparous and multiparous women were included. Women with a prior cesarean were excluded. Refinement of the prediction model was performed using an observational cohort of women from the same institution who underwent an induction (n= 364) during the trial period. An external validation was performed utilizing a publicly available database (Consortium for Safe Labor) that includes information for >200,000 deliveries from 19 hospitals across the United States from 2002 through 2008. After applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized in the derivation cohort, a total of 8466 women remained for analysis. The discriminative power of each model was assessed using a bootstrap, bias-corrected area under the curve.<h4>Results</h4>The cesarean delivery rates in the derivation and external validation groups were: 27.7% (n= 136/491) and 26.4% (n= 2235/8466). In multivariable modeling, nulliparity, gestation age =40 weeks, body mass index at delivery, modified Bishop score, and height were significantly associated with cesarean. A nomogram and calculator were created and found to have an area under the curve in the external validation cohort of 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.74).<h4>Conclusion</h4>A nomogram and user-friendly Web-based calculator that incorporates 5 variables known at the start of induction has been developed and validated. It can be found at: http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/obgyn/labor-induction-calculator/. This calculator can be used to augment patient counseling for women undergoing an induction with an unfavorable cervix.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and insulin tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma insulin and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut microbiota.<h4>Results</h4>Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean  SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2  12.3, HFHS 153.9  19.3, BBE 114.4  14.3, CLE 82.5  13.0, CRE 152.3  24.4, ABE 90.6  18.0, LGE 95.4  10.5) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean  SEM AUC [pmol/l  min]: chow 14.3  1.4, HFHS 31.4  3.1, BBE 27.2  4.0, CLE 17.7  2.2, CRE 32.6  6.3, ABE 22.7  18.0, LGE 23.9  2.5). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced liver triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut-liver axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic insulin clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.<h4>Data availability</h4>All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,deposited data

As more and more RNA 3D structures are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a bioinformatics tool, which is able to rapidly and accurately search the PDB database for similar RNA 3D structures or substructures, is helpful to understand the structural and functional relationships of RNAs. RESULTS:Since its first release in 2011, R3D-BLAST has become a useful tool for searching the PDB database for similar RNA 3D structures and substructures. It was implemented by a structural-alphabet (SA)-based method, which utilizes an SA with 23 structural letters to encode RNA 3D structures into one-dimensional (1D) structural sequences and applies BLAST to the resulting structural sequences for searching similar substructures of RNAs. In this study, we have upgraded R3D-BLAST to develop a new web server named R3D-BLAST2 based on a higher quality SA newly constructed from a representative and sufficiently non-redundant list of RNA 3D structures. In addition, we have modified the kernel program in R3D-BLAST2 so that it can accept an RNA structure in the mmCIF format as an input. The results of our experiments on a benchmark dataset have demonstrated that R3D-BLAST2 indeed performs very well in comparison to its earlier version R3D-BLAST and other similar tools RNA FRABASE, FASTR3D and RAG-3D by searching a larger number of RNA 3D substructures resembling those of the input RNA. CONCLUSIONS:R3D-BLAST2 is a valuable BLAST-like search tool that can more accurately scan the PDB database for similar RNA 3D substructures. It is publicly available at http://genome.cs.nthu.edu.tw/R3D-BLAST2/ .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
29309632,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guidelines on Surgical Resection for the Treatment of Patients With Vestibular Schwannomas.,"QUESTION 1:What surgical approaches for vestibular schwannomas (VS) are best for complete resection and facial nerve (FN) preservation when serviceable hearing is present? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the middle fossa (MF) or the retrosigmoid (RS) approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is present. QUESTION 2:Which surgical approach (RS or translabyrinthine [TL]) for VS is best for complete resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the RS or the TL approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present. QUESTION 3:Does VS size matter for facial and vestibulocochlear nerve preservation with surgical resection? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Patients with larger VS tumor size should be counseled about the greater than average risk of loss of serviceable hearing. QUESTION 4:Should small intracanalicular tumors (<1.5 cm) be surgically resected? RECOMMENDATION:There are insufficient data to support a firm recommendation that surgery be the primary treatment for this subclass of VSs. QUESTION 5:Is hearing preservation routinely possible with VS surgical resection when serviceable hearing is present? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Hearing preservation surgery via the MF or the RS approach may be attempted in patients with small tumor size (<1.5 cm) and good preoperative hearing. QUESTION 6:When should surgical resection be the initial treatment in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence that surgical resection should be the initial treatment in patients with NF2. QUESTION 7:Does a multidisciplinary team, consisting of neurosurgery and neurotology, provides the best outcomes of complete resection and facial/vestibulocochlear nerve preservation for patients undergoing resection of VSs? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support stating that a multidisciplinary team, usually consisting of a neurosurgeon and a neurotologist, provides superior outcomes compared to either subspecialist working alone. QUESTION 8:Does a subtotal surgical resection of a VS followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the residual tumor provide comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support subtotal resection (STR) followed by SRS provides comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection. QUESTION 9:Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative balance problems more effectively than SRS? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support either surgical resection or SRS for treatment of preoperative balance problems. QUESTION 10:Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative trigeminal neuralgia more effectively than SRS? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Surgical resection of VSs may be used to better relieve symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia than SRS. QUESTION 11:Is surgical resection of VSs more difficult (associated with higher facial neuropathies and STR rates) after initial treatment with SRS? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: If microsurgical resection is necessary after SRS, it is recommended that patients be counseled that there is an increased likelihood of a STR and decreased FN function.

29387738,Ocean currents and acoustic backscatter data from shipboard ADCP measurements at three North Atlantic seamounts between 2004 and 2015.,"Seamounts are amongst the most common physiographic structures of the deep-ocean landscape, but remoteness and geographic complexity have limited the systematic collection of integrated and multidisciplinary data in the past. Consequently, important aspects of seamount ecology and dynamics remain poorly studied. We present a data collection of ocean currents and raw acoustic backscatter from shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements during six cruises between 2004 and 2015 in the tropical and subtropical Northeast Atlantic to narrow this gap. Measurements were conducted at seamount locations between the island of Madeira and the Portuguese mainland (Ampre, Seine Seamount), as well as east of the Cape Verde archipelago (Senghor Seamount). The dataset includes two-minute ensemble averaged continuous velocity and backscatter profiles, supplemented by spatially gridded maps for each velocity component, error velocity and local bathymetry.

29512488,S2P: A software tool to quickly carry out reproducible biomedical research projects involving 2D-gel and MALDI-TOF MS protein data.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>2D-gel electrophoresis is widely used in combination with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in order to analyze the proteome of biological samples. For instance, it can be used to discover proteins that are differentially expressed between two groups (e.g. two disease conditions, case vs. control, etc.) thus obtaining a set of potential biomarkers. This procedure requires a great deal of data processing in order to prepare data for analysis or to merge and integrate data from different sources. This kind of work is usually done manually (e.g. copying and pasting data into spreadsheet files), which is highly time consuming and distracts the researcher from other important, core tasks. Moreover, engaging in a repetitive process in a non-automated, handling-based manner is prone to error, thus threatening reliability and reproducibility. The objective of this paper is to present S2P, an open source software to overcome these drawbacks.<h4>Methods</h4>S2P is implemented in Java on top of the AIBench framework, and relies on well-established open source libraries to accomplish different tasks.<h4>Results</h4>S2P is an AIBench based desktop multiplatform application, specifically aimed to process 2D-gel and MALDI-mass spectrometry protein identification-based data in a computer-aided, reproducible manner. Different case studies are presented in order to show the usefulness of S2P.<h4>Conclusions</h4>S2P is open source and free to all users at http://www.sing-group.org/s2p. Through its user-friendly GUI interface, S2P dramatically reduces the time that researchers need to invest in order to prepare data for analysis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
29519778,Outcome of Critically ill Patients Undergoing Mandatory Insulin Therapy Compared to Usual Care Insulin Therapy: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Observational and interventional studies in patients with both acute medical conditions and long-standing diabetes have shown that improved blood glucose control confers a survival advantage or reduces complication rates. Policies of """"tight"""" glycaemic control were rapidly adopted by many general intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide in the mid 00's, even though the results of the studies were not generalizable to mixed medical/surgical ICUs with different intravenous feeding policies. OBJECTIVE:The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of mandatory insulin infusion in critically ill patients in a general ICU setting. METHODS:This protocol summarizes the rationale and design of a randomized, controlled, single-center trial investigating the effect of mandatory insulin therapy versus usual care insulin therapy for those patients admitted for a stay of longer than 48 hours. In total, 109 critically ill adults predicted to stay in intensive care for longer than 48 hours consented. The primary outcome is to determine the safety of mandatory insulin therapy in critically ill patients using the number of episodes of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia per unit length of stay in intensive care. Secondary outcomes include the duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, hospital mortality, and measures of renal, hepatic, and haematological dysfunction. RESULTS:The project was funded in 2005 and enrolment was completed 2007. Data analysis is currently underway and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2018. CONCLUSIONS:This protocol for a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of mandatory insulin therapy should provide an answer to a key question for the management of patients in the ICU and ultimately improving outcome.

29524011,HIVprotI: an integrated web based platform for prediction and design of HIV proteins inhibitors.,"A number of anti-retroviral drugs are being used for treating Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Due to emergence of drug resistant strains, there is a constant quest to discover more effective anti-HIV compounds. In this endeavor, computational tools have proven useful in accelerating drug discovery. Although methods were published to design a class of compounds against a specific HIV protein, but an integrated web server for the same is lacking. Therefore, we have developed support vector machine based regression models using experimentally validated data from ChEMBL repository. Quantitative structure activity relationship based features were selected for predicting inhibition activity of a compound against HIV proteins namely protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). The models presented a maximum Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78, 0.76, 0.74 and 0.76, 0.68, 0.72 during tenfold cross-validation on IC50 and percent inhibition datasets of PR, RT, IN respectively. These models performed equally well on the independent datasets. Chemical space mapping, applicability domain analyses and other statistical tests further support robustness of the predictive models. Currently, we have identified a number of chemical descriptors that are imperative in predicting the compound inhibition potential. HIVprotI platform ( http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/hivproti ) would be useful in virtual screening of inhibitors as well as designing of new molecules against the important HIV proteins for therapeutics development.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data not unique
29527200,Whole Genome Sequence Analysis of CTX-M-15 Producing <i>Klebsiella</i> Isolates Allowed Dissecting a Polyclonal Outbreak Scenario.,"Extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) producing <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> pose an important threat of infection with increased morbidity and mortality, especially for immunocompromised patients. Here, we use the rise of multidrug-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> in a German neurorehabilitation center from April 2015 to April 2016 to dissect the benefit of whole genome sequencing (WGS) for outbreak analyses. In total, 53 isolates were obtained from 52 patients and examined using WGS. Two independent analysis strategies (reference-based and -free) revealed the same distinct clusters of two CTX-M-15 producing <i>K. pneumoniae</i> clones (ST15, <i>n</i> = 31; ST405, <i>n</i> = 7) and one CTX-M-15 producing <i>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</i> strain (ST414, <i>n</i> = 8). Additionally, we determined sequence variations associated with antimicrobial resistance phenotypes in single isolates expressing carbapenem and colistin resistance, respectively. For rapid detection of the major <i>K. pneumoniae</i> outbreak clone (ST15), a selective triplex PCR was deduced from WGS data of the major outbreak strain and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> genome data deposited in central databases. Moreover, we introduce two novel open-source applications supporting reference genome selection (<i>refRank</i>; https://gitlab.com/s.fuchs/refRank) and alignment-based SNP-filtering (<i>SNPfilter</i>; https://gitlab.com/s.fuchs/snpfilter) in NGS analyses.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
29530061,Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis in response to glucose by suppressing PTEN.,"BACKGROUND:Diabetic patients have a higher risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the main enzyme responsible for producing monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFA) from saturated fatty acids, is frequently deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. The function and mechanism of SCD1 in metastasis of CRC and its relevance to glucose remains largely unknown. METHODS:SCD1 expression levels were analyzed in human CRC tissues and the Cancer Browser database ( https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/ ). CRC cell lines stably transfected with SCD1 shRNAs or vector were established to investigate the role of SCD1 in modulating migration and invasion of CRC cells. A glucose concentration gradient was set to investigate regulation of SCD1 in CRC relevant to diabetic conditions. RESULTS:The clinical data analysis showed high expression of SCD1 in CRC tissues with a negative correlation with the prognosis of CRC. In vitro experiments revealed that SCD1 increased CRC progression through promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Lipidomic analysis demonstrated that SCD1 increased MUFA levels and MUFA administration could rescue migration and invasion defect of CRC cells induced by SCD1 knockdown. Furthermore, SCD1-mediated progression of CRC was promoted by carbohydrate response-element binding protein (ChREBP) in response to high glucose. Mechanistically, hyperglycemia-SCD1-MUFA induced CRC cell migration and invasion by regulating PTEN. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings show that SCD1 promotes metastasis of CRC cells through MUFA production and suppressing PTEN in response to glucose, which may be a novel mechanism for diabetes-induced CRC metastasis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

29572201,"Investigating the Impact of Hearing Aid Use and Auditory Training on Cognition, Depressive Symptoms, and Social Interaction in Adults With Hearing Loss: Protocol for a Crossover Trial.","BACKGROUND:Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit among older adults. Some of the psychosocial consequences of this condition include difficulty in understanding speech, depression, and social isolation. Studies have shown that older adults with hearing loss show some age-related cognitive decline. Hearing aids have been proven as successful interventions to alleviate sensorineural hearing loss. In addition to hearing aid use, the positive effects of auditory training-formal listening activities designed to optimize speech perception-are now being documented among adults with hearing loss who use hearing aids, especially new hearing aid users. Auditory training has also been shown to produce prolonged cognitive performance improvements. However, there is still little evidence to support the benefits of simultaneous hearing aid use and individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognitive performance in adults with hearing loss. OBJECTIVE:This study will investigate whether using hearing aids for the first time will improve the impact of individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognition, depression, and social interaction for adults with sensorineural hearing loss. The rationale for this study is based on the hypothesis that, in adults with sensorineural hearing loss, using hearing aids for the first time in combination with individualized face-to-face auditory training will be more effective for improving cognition, depressive symptoms, and social interaction rather than auditory training on its own. METHODS:This is a crossover trial targeting 40 men and women between 50 and 90 years of age with either mild or moderate symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. Consented, willing participants will be recruited from either an independent living accommodation or via a community database to undergo a 6-month intensive face-to-face auditory training program (active control). Participants will be assigned in random order to receive hearing aid (intervention) for either the first 3 or last 3 months of the 6-month auditory training program. Each participant will be tested at baseline, 3, and 6 months using a neuropsychological battery of computer-based cognitive assessments, together with a depression symptom instrument and a social interaction measure. The primary outcome will be cognitive performance with regard to spatial working memory. Secondary outcome measures include other cognition performance measures, depressive symptoms, social interaction, and hearing satisfaction. RESULTS:Data analysis is currently under way and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in June 2018. CONCLUSIONS:Results from the study will inform strategies for aural rehabilitation, hearing aid delivery, and future hearing loss intervention trials.

Online miRNA database (http://www.bioguo.org) was utilized to explore gene polymorphism in MMP9 3'UTR that might break the interaction between MMP9 and miRNA. Luciferase assay was utilized to confirm the miRNA targeted MMP9. Real-time PCR, westernblot analysis and immunohistochemistry were carried out to understand the roles of MMP9 in PU as well as how rs1056629 in MMP9 3'UTR compromises the interaction between MMP9 and miR-491. rs1056629 in MMP9 3'UTR that compromised the interaction between MMP9 and four miRNAs including miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941, and only miR-491 among miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 decreased luciferase activity of wild-type MMP9 3'UTR, and luciferase activities of mutant-3 and mutant-4 MMP9 3'UTR in miR-491 overexpressing cells was comparable with scramble control. miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 levels in PU group was comparable with healthy control, and miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 in subjects carrying AA genotype was similar with those in AC and CC groups. MMP9 mRNA and protein, and histology score in subjects with PU were much higher, and were also much higher in AA group. Only miR-491 mimic among miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 mimics downregulated the MMP9 level, and only miR-491 inhibitor among miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 inhibitors upregulated the MMP9 level. Our study indicated that rs1056629 polymorphism could be a novel biomarker for predicting the occurrence of PU after a hip fracture.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource
29630775,PR-10 proteins as potential mediators of melatonin-cytokinin cross-talk in plants: crystallographic studies of LlPR-10.2B isoform from yellow lupine.,"LlPR-10.2B, a Pathogenesis-related class 10 (PR-10) protein from yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) was crystallized in complex with melatonin, an emerging important plant regulator and antioxidant. The structure reveals two molecules of melatonin bound in the internal cavity of the protein, plus a very well-defined electron density near the cavity entrance, corresponding to an unknown ligand molecule comprised of two flat rings, which is most likely a product of melatonin transformation. In a separate LlPR-10.2B co-crystallization experiment with an equimolar mixture of melatonin and trans-zeatin, which is a cytokinin phytohormone well recognized as a PR-10-binding partner, a quaternary 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 complex was formed, in which one of the melatonin-binding sites has been substituted with trans-zeatin, whereas the binding of melatonin at the second binding site and binding of the unknown ligand are undisturbed. This unusual complex, when compared with the previously described PR-10/trans-zeatin complexes and with the emerging structural information about melatonin binding by PR-10 proteins, provides intriguing insights into the role of PR-10 proteins in phytohormone regulation in plants, especially with the involvement of melatonin, and implicates the PR-10 proteins as low-affinity melatonin binders under the conditions of elevated melatonin concentration.

We measured traits reported by parents and teachers as well as the child's performance on tests that evaluate the ability to use facial expressions to recognize the mental state of others at 7, 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, and 14 years of age.<h4>Results</h4>Prenatal DAPs were associated with poorer parent and teacher reported social behavior [e.g., a 10-fold DAP increase was associated with a 2.7-point increase (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 4.5) in parent-reported Social Responsiveness Scale, Version 2, T-scores at age 14]. We did not find clear evidence of associations between residential proximity to OP use during pregnancy and ASD-related traits.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings contribute mixed evidence linking OP pesticide exposures with traits related to developmental disorders like ASD. Subtle pesticide-related effects on ASD-related traits among a population with ubiquitous exposure could result in a rise in cases of clinically diagnosed disorders like ASD. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2580.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
29703719,Sialic Acid Blockade Suppresses Tumor Growth by Enhancing T-cell-Mediated Tumor Immunity.,"Sialic acid sugars on the surface of cancer cells have emerged as potent immune modulators that contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment and tumor immune evasion. However, the mechanisms by which these sugars modulate antitumor immunity as well as therapeutic strategies directed against them are limited. Here we report that intratumoral injections with a sialic acid mimetic Ac<sub>5</sub>3F<sub>ax</sub>Neu5Ac block tumor sialic acid expression <i>in vivo</i> and suppress tumor growth in multiple tumor models. Sialic acid blockade had a major impact on the immune cell composition of the tumor, enhancing tumor-infiltrating natural killer cell and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers while reducing regulatory T-cell and myeloid regulatory cell numbers. Sialic acid blockade enhanced cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells in part by facilitating antigen-specific T-cell-tumor cell clustering. Sialic acid blockade also synergized with adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <i>in vivo</i> and enhanced CpG immune adjuvant therapy by increasing dendritic cell activation and subsequent CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Collectively, these data emphasize the crucial role of sialic acids in tumor immune evasion and provide proof of concept that sialic acid blockade creates an immune-permissive tumor microenvironment for CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated tumor immunity, either as single treatment or in combination with other immune-based intervention strategies.<b>Significance:</b> Sialic acid sugars function as important modulators of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that limit potent antitumor immunity.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/13/3574/F1.large.jpg <i>Cancer Res; 78(13); 3574-88. 2018 AACR</i>.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Walkable neighborhoods have been associated with physical activity, but more rigorous analytical approaches are needed.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used longitudinal data from adult residents of Brisbane, Australia (40-65 years of age at baseline) to estimate effects of changes in neighborhood characteristics over a 6-y period on the likelihood of walking for transport.<h4>Methods</h4>Analyses included 2,789-9,747 How Areas Influence Health and Activity (HABITAT) cohort participants from 200 neighborhoods at baseline (2007) who completed up to three follow-up questionnaires (through 2013). Principal components analysis was used to derive a proxy measure of walkability preference. Environmental predictors were changes in street connectivity, residential density, and land use mix within a one-kilometer network buffer. Associations with any walking and minutes of walking were estimated using logistic and linear regression, including random effects models adjusted for time-varying confounders and a measure of walkability preference, and fixed effects models of changes in individuals to eliminate confounding by time-invariant characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Any walking for transport (vs. none) was increased in association with an increase in street connectivity (+10 intersections, fixed effects OR=1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07, 1.32), residential density (+5 dwellings/hectare, OR=1.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.15), and land-use mix (10% increase, OR=1.12; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.26). Associations with minutes of walking were positive based on random effects models, but null for fixed effects models. The association between land-use mix and any walking appeared to be limited to participants in the highest tertile of increased street connectivity (fixed effects OR=1.17; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.35 for a 1-unit increase in land-use mix; interaction <i>p</i>-value=0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Increases in street connectivity, residential density, and land-use heterogeneity were associated with walking for transport among middle-age residents of Brisbane, Australia. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2080.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

We analyzed mRNA expression level of CD177 and clinical follow-up survey of PDAC to estimate overall survival (OS) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE21501, containing samples from 102 PDAC patients) by R2 platform (http://r2.amc.nl). We also analyzed correlated genes of CD177 by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to predict the potential relationship between neutrophils and prognosis of PDAC. We then performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens to verify infiltration of neutrophils in PDAC tissues. After analyzing mRNA expression data and clinical follow-up survey provided in the GEO dataset (GSE21501, containing samples from 102 PDAC patients) and clinicopathological data of 23 PDAC patients, we demonstrated that CD177 was correlated with poor prognosis. The univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that OS was inversely associated with increased expression of CD177 (P=0.012). Expression of phosphodiesterase (PDE)4D was positively related to CD177 in gene correlation analysis (R=0.413, P<0.001) by R2 platform. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of CD177 in 23 PDAC surgical samples showed accumulation of neutrophils in the stroma and blood vessels around the cancer cells. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that CD177 was highly expressed in the stroma and blood vessels around tumor tissues of PDAC, which was similar to H&E staining. Expression of CD177 can be used to represent infiltration of neutrophils, which may have potential prognostic value in PDAC.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
29743730,Evaluating soil moisture retrievals from ESA's SMOS and NASA's SMAP brightness temperature datasets.,"Two satellites are currently monitoring surface soil moisture (SM) using L-band observations: SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), a joint ESA (European Space Agency), CNES (Centre national d'tudes spatiales), and CDTI (the Spanish government agency with responsibility for space) satellite launched on November 2, 2009 and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive), a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite successfully launched in January 2015. In this study, we used a multilinear regression approach to retrieve SM from SMAP data to create a global dataset of SM, which is consistent with SM data retrieved from SMOS. This was achieved by calibrating coefficients of the regression model using the CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnes) SMOS Level 3 SM and the horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperatures (TB) at 40 incidence angle, over the 2013 - 2014 period. Next, this model was applied to SMAP L3 TB data from Apr 2015 to Jul 2016. The retrieved SM from SMAP (referred to here as SMAP_Reg) was compared to: (i) the operational SMAP L3 SM (SMAP_SCA), retrieved using the baseline Single Channel retrieval Algorithm (SCA); and (ii) the operational SMOSL3 SM, derived from the multiangular inversion of the L-MEB model (L-MEB algorithm) (SMOSL3). This inter-comparison was made against <i>in situ</i> soil moisture measurements from more than 400 sites spread over the globe, which are used here as a reference soil moisture dataset. The <i>in situ</i> observations were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/) in North of America (PBO_H2O, SCAN, SNOTEL, iRON, and USCRN), in Australia (Oznet), Africa (DAHRA), and in Europe (REMEDHUS, SMOSMANIA, FMI, and RSMN). The agreement was analyzed in terms of four classical statistical criteria: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Unbiased RMSE (UnbRMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Results of the comparison of these various products with <i>in situ</i> observations show that the performance of both SMAP products i.e. SMAP_SCA and SMAP_Reg is similar and marginally better to that of the SMOSL3 product particularly over the PBO_H2O, SCAN, and USCRN sites. However, SMOSL3 SM was closer to the <i>in situ</i> observations over the DAHRA and Oznet sites. We found that the correlation between all three datasets and <i>in situ</i> measurements is best (R > 0.80) over the Oznet sites and worst (R = 0.58) over the SNOTEL sites for SMAP_SCA and over the DAHRA and SMOSMANIA sites (R= 0.51 and R= 0.45 for SMAP_Reg and SMOSL3, respectively). The Bias values showed that all products are generally dry, except over RSMN, DAHRA, and Oznet (and FMI for SMAP_SCA). Finally, our analysis provided interesting insights that can be useful to improve the consistency between SMAP and SMOS datasets.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

TRs are a widespread but poorly annotated class of non-globular proteins carrying heterogeneous functions. RepeatsDB-lite extends the prediction to all TR types and strongly improves the performance both in terms of computational time and accuracy over previous methods, with precision above 95% for solenoid structures. The algorithm exploits an improved TR unit library derived from the RepeatsDB database to perform an iterative structural search and assignment. The web interface provides tools for analyzing the evolutionary relationships between units and manually refine the prediction by changing unit positions and protein classification. An all-against-all structure-based sequence similarity matrix is calculated and visualized in real-time for every user edit. Reviewed predictions can be submitted to RepeatsDB for review and inclusion.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,"affliated with a DB, but a server for it…"

Few methods, however, currently exist to analyze and visualize the complex data that is produced, which can encode the localization and expression of a million or more individual transcripts in a tissue section. Here, we present InsituNet, an application that converts in situ sequencing data into interactive network-based visualizations, where each unique transcript is a node in the network and edges represent the spatial co-expression relationships between transcripts. InsituNet is available as an app for the Cytoscape platform at http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/insitunet. InsituNet enables the analysis of the relationships that existbetween these transcripts and can uncover how spatial co-expression profiles change in different regions of the tissue or across different tissue sections.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
29757429,AlloFinder: a strategy for allosteric modulator discovery and allosterome analyses.,"Allostery tweaks innumerable biological processes and plays a fundamental role in human disease and drug discovery. Exploration of allostery has thus been regarded as a crucial requirement for research on biological mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutics. Here, based on our previously developed allosteric data and methods, we present an interactive platform called AlloFinder that identifies potential endogenous or exogenous allosteric modulators and their involvement in human allosterome. AlloFinder automatically amalgamates allosteric site identification, allosteric screening and allosteric scoring evaluation of modulator-protein complexes to identify allosteric modulators, followed by allosterome mapping analyses of predicted allosteric sites and modulators in human proteome. This web server exhibits prominent performance in the reemergence of allosteric metabolites and exogenous allosteric modulators in known allosteric proteins. Specifically, AlloFinder enables identification of allosteric metabolites for metabolic enzymes and screening of potential allosteric compounds for disease-related targets. Significantly, the feasibility of AlloFinder to discover allosteric modulators was tested in a real case of signal transduction and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) and validated by mutagenesis and functional experiments. Collectively, AlloFinder is expected to contribute to exploration of the mechanisms of allosteric regulation between metabolites and metabolic enzymes, and to accelerate allosteric drug discovery.

It is the hope that this Guideline becomes a reference on the effective evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS:The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) database to identify studies indexed between January 2007 and September 2017. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/). RESULTS:This Guideline provides updated, evidence-based recommendations regarding management of LUTS/BPH utilizing surgery and minimally invasive surgical therapies; additional statements are made regarding diagnostic and pre-operative tests. Clinical statements are made in comparison to what is generally accepted as the gold standard (i.e. transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP]-monopolar and/or bipolar). This guideline is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence and the severity of LUTS increases as men age and is an important diagnosis in the healthcare of patients and the welfare of society. This document will undergo additional literature reviews and updating as the knowledge regarding current treatments and future surgical options continues to expand.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

29806693,Neuronal calcineurin transcriptional targets parallel changes observed in Alzheimer disease brain.,"Synaptic dysfunction and loss are core pathological features in Alzheimer disease (AD). In the vicinity of amyloid- plaques in animal models, synaptic toxicity occurs and is associated with chronic activation of the phosphatase calcineurin (CN). Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of CN blocks amyloid- synaptotoxicity. We therefore hypothesized that CN-mediated transcriptional changes may contribute to AD neuropathology and tested this by examining the impact of CN over-expression on neuronal gene expression invivo. We found dramatic transcriptional down-regulation, especially of synaptic mRNAs, in neurons chronically exposed to CN activation. Importantly, the transcriptional profile parallels the changes in human AD tissue. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that both nuclear factor of activated T cells and numerous microRNAs may all be impacted by CN, andparallel findings are observed in AD. These data and analyses support the hypothesis that at least part of the synaptic failure characterizing AD may result from aberrant CN activation leading to down-regulation of synaptic genes, potentially via activation of specific transcription factors and expression of repressive microRNAs.<h4>Open practices</h4>Open Science: This manuscript was awarded with the Open Materials Badge.

29843602,"Combining RNA-seq data and homology-based gene prediction for plants, animals and fungi.","<h4>Background</h4>Genome annotation is of key importance in many research questions. The identification of protein-coding genes is often based on transcriptome sequencing data, ab-initio or homology-based prediction. Recently, it was demonstrated that intron position conservation improves homology-based gene prediction, and that experimental data improves ab-initio gene prediction.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present an extension of the gene prediction program GeMoMa that utilizes amino acid sequence conservation, intron position conservation and optionally RNA-seq data for homology-based gene prediction. We show on published benchmark data for plants, animals and fungi that GeMoMa performs better than the gene prediction programs BRAKER1, MAKER2, and CodingQuarry, and purely RNA-seq-based pipelines for transcript identification. In addition, we demonstrate that using multiple reference organisms may help to further improve the performance of GeMoMa. Finally, we apply GeMoMa to four nematode species and to the recently published barley reference genome indicating that current annotations of protein-coding genes may be refined using GeMoMa predictions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GeMoMa might be of great utility for annotating newly sequenced genomes but also for finding homologs of a specific gene or gene family.

29956198,Prognostic Impact of Extracapsular Lymph Node Invasion on Survival in Non-small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The extracapsular tumor extension (ECE) of nodal metastasis is an important prognostic factor in different types of malignancies. However, there is a lack of recent data in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, the TNM staging system does not include ECE status as a prognostic factor. This systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to summarize and pool existing data to determine the prognostic role of ECE in patients with lymph node-positive NSCLC. Two authors performed an independent search in PubMed using a predefined keyword list, without language restrictions with publication date since 1990. Prospective or retrospective studies reporting data on prognostic parameters in subjects with NSCLC with positive ECE or with only intracapsular lymph node metastasis were retrieved. Data were summarized using risk ratios (RR) for the survival with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data was analyzed using Mix 2 (ref: Bax L: MIX 2.0 - Professional software for meta-analysis in Excel. Version 2.015. BiostatXL, 2016. https://www.meta-analysis-made-easy.com ). There 2,105 studies were reviewed. Five studies covering a total of 828 subjects met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Two hundred and ninety-eight (35.9%) patients were categorized as ECE+, of whom 54 (18.1%) survived at the end of follow-up. In the ECE-negative group, 257 patients (48.4%) survived by the end of follow-up. Thus, ECE status is associated with a significantly decreased survival rate: pooled RR 0.45 (95% CI 0.35-0.59), Q <sub>(4)</sub>=4.06, P <sub>value</sub>=0.39, and I <sup>2</sup>=68.00% (95 CI 0.00-79.55%). In conclusion, ECE has a significant impact on survival in NSCLC patients and should be considered in diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in addition to the current TNM staging. Postoperative radiotherapy may be an option in ECE-positive pN1 NSCLC patients.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

29983907,Rapid onset of action and reduced nasal hyperreactivity: new targets in allergic rhinitis management.,"<h4>Background</h4>This article summarizes a EUFOREA symposium, presented during the European Rhinology Research Forum in Brussels (9-10 November 2017; https://www.rhinologyresearch.eu/) which focused on novel pathways and therapeutic approaches in allergic rhinitis (AR).<h4>Main body</h4>AR remains under-diagnosed, under-estimated and under-treated. A key component in understanding the AR landscape has been the realization of a significant mismatch between how physicians instruct AR patients to manage their disease and what AR patients actually do in real life. Data from the <i>Allergy Diary</i> (developed by MACVIA ARIA) showed that AR patients take their medication prn, rapidly switch treatments, often experience poor control, use multiple therapies and stop treatment when symptoms are controlled. Better control of AR may be achievable by using an AR treatment which has a rapid onset of action and which effectively targets breakthrough symptoms. Indeed, AR patients report complete symptom relief, lack of breakthrough symptoms, rapid onset of action, safety and use on an 'as needed' basis as key targets for new nasal sprays. MP-AzeFlu comprises intranasal azelastine and fluticasone propionate (FP) in a novel formulation delivered in a single device. It is the first AR treatment to break the 5min onset of action threshold and provides clinically relevant symptom relief in 15min, much faster than that noted for FP + oral loratadine. MP-AzeFlu also significantly reduces nasal hyperresponsiveness (NHR) which may be responsible for the breakthrough symptoms frequently reported by AR patients. Mechanisms underlying MP-AzeFlu's effect include inhibition of mast cell degranulation, stabilization of the mucosal barrier, synergistic inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment and a unique desensitization of sensory neurons expressing the transient receptor potential A1 and V1 channels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>With the most rapid onset of action and onset of clinically-relevant effect of any AR medication currently available, and proven efficacy in the treatment of NHR, MP-AzeFlu is an AR treatment which provides what patients want, and fits how patients manage their AR in real life.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

There are several programs that can achieve highly automated NMR signal assignments and structure analysis. On the other hand, NMR spectra tend to have a large number of noise peaks even for data acquired with good sample and machine conditions, and it is still difficult to eliminate these noise peaks.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a method to eliminate noise peaks using convolutional neural networks, implemented in the program package Filt_Robot. The filtering accuracy of Filt_Robot was around 90-95% when applied to 2D and 3D NMR spectra, and the numbers of resulting non-noise peaks were close to those in corresponding manually prepared peaks lists. The filtering can strongly enhance automated NMR spectra analysis.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The full package of the program, documents and example data are available from http://bmrbdep.pdbj.org/en/nmr_tool_box/Filt_Robot.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

30026590,Adult energy requirements predicted from doubly labeled water.,"<h4>Background</h4>Estimating energy requirements forms an integral part of developing diet and activity interventions. Current estimates often rely on a product of physical activity level (PAL) and a resting metabolic rate (RMR) prediction. PAL estimates, however, typically depend on subjective self-reported activity or a clinician's best guess. Energy-requirement models that do not depend on an input of PAL may provide an attractive alternative.<h4>Methods</h4>Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) measured by doubly labeled water (DLW) and a metabolic chamber from 119 subjects obtained from a database of pre-intervention measurements measured at Pennington Biomedical Research Center were used to develop a metabolic ward and free-living models that predict energy requirements. Graded models, including different combinations of input variables consisting of age, height, weight, waist circumference, body composition, and the resting metabolic rate were developed. The newly developed models were validated and compared to three independent databases.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-four different linear and nonlinear regression models were developed. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> for models predicting free-living energy requirements ranged from 0.65 with covariates of age, height, and weight to 0.74 in models that included body composition and RMR. Independent validation R<sup>2</sup> between actual and predicted TEE varied greatly across studies and between genders with higher coefficients of determination, lower bias, slopes closer to 1, and intercepts closer to zero, associated with inclusion of body composition and RMR covariates.

We have applied the same classification algorithm to four different datasets from ADNI, Health Science Centre (Winnipeg, Canada), Dong-A University Hospital (Busan, S. Korea) and Asan Medical Centre (Seoul, S. Korea). Our data analyses confirmed that the support vector machine with Iterative Single Data Algorithm showed the best performance in prediction of future development of AD from the prodromal stage (mild cognitive impairment), and that it was also sensitive to other types of dementia such as Parkinson's Disease Dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and that perfusion imaging using single photon emission computed tomography may achieve a similar accuracy to that of FDG-PET.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,clinical
30200994,TAP: a targeted clinical genomics pipeline for detecting transcript variants using RNA-seq data.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA-seq is a powerful and cost-effective technology for molecular diagnostics of cancer and other diseases, and it can reach its full potential when coupled with validated clinical-grade informatics tools. Despite recent advances in long-read sequencing, transcriptome assembly of short reads remains a useful and cost-effective methodology for unveiling transcript-level rearrangements and novel isoforms. One of the major concerns for adopting the proven de novo assembly approach for RNA-seq data in clinical settings has been the analysis turnaround time. To address this concern, we have developed a targeted approach to expedite assembly and analysis of RNA-seq data.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present our Targeted Assembly Pipeline (TAP), which consists of four stages: 1) alignment-free gene-level classification of RNA-seq reads using BioBloomTools, 2) de novo assembly of individual targets using Trans-ABySS, 3) alignment of assembled contigs to the reference genome and transcriptome with GMAP and BWA and 4) structural and splicing variant detection using PAVFinder. We show that PAVFinder is a robust gene fusion detection tool when compared to established methods such as Tophat-Fusion and deFuse on simulated data of 448 events. Using the Leucegene acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq data and a set of 580 COSMIC target genes, TAP identified a wide range of hallmark molecular anomalies including gene fusions, tandem duplications, insertions and deletions in agreement with published literature results. Moreover, also in this dataset, TAP captured AML-specific splicing variants such as skipped exons and novel splice sites reported in studies elsewhere. Running time of TAP on 100-150 million read pairs and a 580-gene set is one to 2 hours on a 48-core machine.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that TAP is a fast and robust RNA-seq variant detection pipeline that is potentially amenable to clinical applications.

30202060,Terminal exon characterization with TECtool reveals an abundance of cell-specific isoforms.,"Sequencing of RNA 3' ends has uncovered numerous sites that do not correspond to the termination sites of known transcripts. Through their 3' untranslated regions, protein-coding RNAs interact with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, which regulate many properties, including RNA stability and subcellular localization. We developed the terminal exon characterization (TEC) tool ( http://tectool.unibas.ch ), which can be used with RNA-sequencing data from any species for which a genome annotation that includes sites of RNA cleavage and polyadenylation is available. We discovered hundreds of previously unknown isoforms and cell-type-specific terminal exons in human cells. Ribosome profiling data revealed that many of these isoforms were translated. By applying TECtool to single-cell sequencing data, we found that the newly identified isoforms were expressed in subpopulations of cells. Thus, TECtool enables the identification of previously unknown isoforms in well-studied cell systems and in rare cell types.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

30219490,Changing labour market conditions during the 'great recession' and mental health in Scotland 2007-2011: an example using the Scottish Longitudinal Study and data for local areas in Scotland.,"This paper reports research exploring how trends in local labour market conditions during the period 2007-2011 (early stages of the 'great recession') relate to reported mental illness for individuals. It contributes to research on spatio-temporal variation in the wider determinants of health, exploring how the lifecourse of places relates to socio-geographical inequalities in health outcomes for individuals. This study also contributes to the renewed research focus on the links between labour market trends and population health, prompted by the recent global economic recession. We report research using the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), a 5.3% representative sample of the Scottish population, derived from census data (https://sls.lscs.ac.uk/). In Scotland, (2011) census data include self-reported mental health. SLS data were combined with non-disclosive information from other sources, including spatio-temporal trends in labour market conditions (calculated using trajectory modelling) in the 32 local authority areas in Scotland. We show that, for groups of local authorities in Scotland over the period 2007-2011, trends in employment varied. These geographically variable trends in employment rates were associated with inequalities in self-reported mental health across the country, after controlling for a number of other individual and neighbourhood risk factors. For residents of regions that had experienced relatively high and stable levels of employment the odds ratio for reporting a mental illness was significantly lower than for the 'reference group', living in areas with persistently low employment rates. In areas where employment declined markedly from higher levels, the odds ratio was similar to the reference group. The findings emphasise how changes in local economic conditions may influence people's health and wellbeing independently of their own employment status. We conclude that, during the recent recession, the economic life course of places across Scotland has been associated with individual mental health outcomes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30239574,A clustering linear combination approach to jointly analyze multiple phenotypes for GWAS.,"<h4>Summary</h4>There is an increasing interest in joint analysis of multiple phenotypes for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on the following reasons. First, cohorts usually collect multiple phenotypes and complex diseases are usually measured by multiple correlated intermediate phenotypes. Second, jointly analyzing multiple phenotypes may increase statistical power for detecting genetic variants associated with complex diseases. Third, there is increasing evidence showing that pleiotropy is a widespread phenomenon in complex diseases. In this paper, we develop a clustering linear combination (CLC) method to jointly analyze multiple phenotypes for GWASs. In the CLC method, we first cluster individual statistics into positively correlated clusters and then, combine the individual statistics linearly within each cluster and combine the between-cluster terms in a quadratic form. CLC is not only robust to different signs of the means of individual statistics, but also reduce the degrees of freedom of the test statistic. We also theoretically prove that if we can cluster the individual statistics correctly, CLC is the most powerful test among all tests with certain quadratic forms. Our simulation results show that CLC is either the most powerful test or has similar power to the most powerful test among the tests we compared, and CLC is much more powerful than other tests when effect sizes align with inferred clusters. We also evaluate the performance of CLC through a real case study.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>R code for implementing our method is available at http://www.math.mtu.edu/~shuzhang/software.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30299485,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guidelines on the Evaluation and Treatment of Patients With Thoracolumbar Spine Trauma: Novel Surgical Strategies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures has traditionally involved spinal instrumentation with fusion performed with standard open surgical techniques. Novel surgical strategies, including instrumentation without fusion and percutaneous instrumentation alone, have been considered less invasive and more efficient treatments.<h4>Objective</h4>To review the current literature and determine the role of fusion in instrumented fixation, as well as the role of percutaneous instrumentation, in the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.<h4>Methods</h4>The task force members identified search terms/parameters and a medical librarian implemented the literature search, consistent with the literature search protocol (see Appendix I), using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for the period from January 1, 1946 to March 31, 2015.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 906 articles were identified and 38 were selected for full-text review. Of these articles, 12 articles met criteria for inclusion in this systematic review.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There is grade A evidence for the omission of fusion in instrumented fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. There is grade B evidence that percutaneous instrumentation is as effective as open instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures.<h4>Question</h4>Does the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented fixation improve outcomes in patients with thoracic and lumbar burst fractures?<h4>Recommendation</h4>It is recommended that in the surgical treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, surgeons should understand that the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented stabilization has not been shown to impact clinical or radiological outcomes, and adds to increased blood loss and operative time. Strength of Recommendation: Grade A.<h4>Question</h4>How does the use of minimally invasive techniques (including percutaneous instrumentation) affect outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for thoracic and lumbar fractures compared to conventional open techniques?<h4>Recommendation</h4>Stabilization using both open and percutaneous pedicle screws may be considered in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures as the evidence suggests equivalent clinical outcomes.

30302823,Overlapping clustering of gene expression data using penalized weighted normalized cut.,"Clustering has been widely conducted in the analysis of gene expression data. For complex diseases, it has played an important role in identifying unknown functions of genes, serving as the basis of other analysis, and others. A common limitation of most existing clustering approaches is to assume that genes are separated into disjoint clusters. As genes often have multiple functions and thus can belong to more than one functional cluster, the disjoint clustering results can be unsatisfactory. In addition, due to the small sample sizes of genetic profiling studies and other factors, there may not be sufficient evidence to confirm the specific functions of some genes and cluster them definitively into disjoint clusters. In this study, we develop an effective overlapping clustering approach, which takes account into the multiplicity of gene functions and lack of certainty in practical analysis. A penalized weighted normalized cut (PWNCut) criterion is proposed based on the NCut technique and an <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub> </mml:math> norm constraint. It outperforms multiple competitors in simulation. The analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data on breast cancer and cervical cancer leads to biologically sensible findings which differ from those using the alternatives. To facilitate implementation, we develop the function pwncut in the R package NCutYX.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

30367593,On the impact of uncertain gene tree rooting on duplication-transfer-loss reconciliation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Duplication-Transfer-Loss (DTL) reconciliation is a powerful and increasingly popular technique for studying the evolution of microbial gene families. DTL reconciliation requires the use of rooted gene trees to perform the reconciliation with the species tree, and the standard technique for rooting gene trees is to assign a root that results in the minimum reconciliation cost across all rootings of that gene tree. However, even though it is well understood that many gene trees have multiple optimal roots, only a single optimal root is randomly chosen to create the rooted gene tree and perform the reconciliation. This remains an important overlooked and unaddressed problem in DTL reconciliation, leading to incorrect evolutionary inferences. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of the impact of uncertain gene tree rooting on the computed DTL reconciliation and provide the first computational tools to quantify and negate the impact of gene tree rooting uncertainty on DTL reconciliation.<h4>Results</h4>Our analysis of a large data set of over 4500 gene families from 100 species shows that a large fraction of gene trees have multiple optimal rootings, that these multiple roots often, but not always, appear closely clustered together in the same region of the gene tree, that many aspects of the reconciliation remain conserved across the multiple rootings, that gene tree error has a profound impact on the prevalence and structure of multiple optimal rootings, and that there are specific interesting patterns in the reconciliation of those gene trees that have multiple optimal roots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show that unrooted gene trees can be meaningfully reconciled and high-quality evolutionary information can be obtained from them even after accounting for multiple optimal rootings. In addition, the techniques and tools introduced in this paper make it possible to systematically avoid incorrect evolutionary inferences caused by incorrect or uncertain gene tree rooting.

30387741,A Note on GRegNetSim: A Tool for the Discrete Simulation and Analysis of Genetic Regulatory Networks.,"Discrete simulations of genetic regulatory networks were used to study subsystems of yeast successfully. However, implementations of existing models underlying these simulations do not support a graphic interface, and require computations necessary to analyze their results to be done manually. Furthermore, differences between existing models suggest that an enriched model, encompassing both existing models, is needed. We developed a software tool, GRegNetSim, that allows the end-user to describe genetic regulatory networks graphically. The user can specify various transition functions at different nodes of the network, supporting, for example, threshold and gradient effects, and then apply the network to a variety of inputs. GRegNetSim displays the relationship between the inputs and the mode of behavior of the network in a graphic form that is easy to interpret. Furthermore, it can automatically extract statistical data necessary to analyze the simulations. The discrete simulations performed by GRegNetSim can be used to elucidate and predict the behavior, structure and properties of genetic regulatory networks in a unified manner. GRegNetSim is implemented as a Cytoscape App. Installation files, examples and source code, along with a detailed user guide, are freely available at https://sites.google.com/site/gregnetsim/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30411228,Steady Flow in a Patient-Averaged Inferior Vena Cava-Part I: Particle Image Velocimetry Measurements at Rest and Exercise Conditions.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Although many previous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies have investigated the hemodynamics in the inferior vena cava (IVC), few studies have compared computational predictions to experimental data, and only qualitative comparisons have been made. Herein, we provide particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of flow in a patient-averaged IVC geometry under idealized conditions typical of those used in the preclinical evaluation of IVC filters.<h4>Methods</h4>Measurements are acquired under rest and exercise flow rate conditions in an optically transparent model fabricated using 3D printing. To ensure that boundary conditions are well-defined and to make follow-on CFD validation studies more convenient, fully-developed flow is provided at the inlets (i.e., the iliac veins) by extending them with straight rigid tubing longer than the estimated entrance lengths. Velocity measurements are then obtained at the downstream end of the tubing to confirm Poiseuille inflow boundary conditions.<h4>Results</h4>Measurements in the infrarenal IVC reveal that flow profiles are blunter in the sagittal plane (minor axis) than in the coronal plane (major axis). Peak in-plane velocity magnitudes are 4.9cm/s and 27cm/s under the rest and exercise conditions, respectively. Flow profiles are less parabolic and exhibit more inflection points at the higher flow rate. Bimodal velocity peaks are also observed in the sagittal plane at the elevated flow condition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The IVC geometry, boundary conditions, and infrarenal velocity measurements are provided for download on a free and publicly accessible repositoryat https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7198703 . These data will facilitate future CFD validation studies of idealized, in vitro IVC hemodynamics and of similar laminar flows in vascular geometries.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30422398,Structural basis for protein phosphatase 1 recruitment by glycogen-targeting subunits.,"The rate-limiting enzymes in glycogen metabolism are subject to regulation by reversible phosphorylation. The glycogen-targeted protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) holoenzyme catalyzes their dephosphorylation. It is composed of a catalytic subunit (PP1C) and a glycogen-targeting subunit (G subunit). To date, seven G subunits have been identified. They all contain an RVxF PP1C-binding motif. The interactions between this motif in the skeletal muscle-specific G<sub>M</sub> and PP1C have been revealed by structural studies. However, whether elements outside of this motif contribute to the interaction with PP1C is not clear. In this study, we found that residues next to the RVxF motif in G<sub>M</sub> also mediate interactions to PP1C and revealed the mechanism of the interaction by structural studies. Sequence analysis revealed that the PP1C-binding region in G<sub>M</sub> is highly conserved among G subunits. Consistently, we found that the equivalent region in the liver-enriched G<sub>L</sub> adopts a similar structure upon binding PP1C. Dephosphorylation experiments indicated that this region and the glycogen-binding region in G<sub>M</sub> cooperate to stimulate PP1C's activity toward glycogen-associated substrates. DATABASES: The structure factors and coordinates for the PP1Ca-G<sub>M</sub> (1-99) and PP1Ca-G<sub>L</sub> (31-105) complexes have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org), with the accession codes 5ZQV and 5ZT0, respectively.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30423080,DREAM-Yara: an exact read mapper for very large databases with short update time.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mapping-based approaches have become limited in their application to very large sets of references since computing an FM-index for very large databases (e.g. >10 GB) has become a bottleneck. This affects many analyses that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full-text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about 1 day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times.<h4>Results</h4>To solve the index construction and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time. The second main contribution is an implementation of DREAM-Yara a distributed version of a fully sensitive read mapper under the DREAM framework.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://gitlab.com/pirovc/dream_yara/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

In this issue of the <i>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</i>, Nguyen et al. (M. Nguyen, S. W. Long, P. F. McDermott, R. J. Olsen, R. Olson, R. L. Stevens, G. H. Tyson, S. Zhao, and J. J.

Their major finding demonstrates that MICs can be predicted with an average accuracy of 95% within 1 2-fold dilution step (confidence interval, 95% to 95%), an average very major error rate of 2.7%, and an average major error rate of 0.1%. Importantly, these models predict MICs with no <i>a priori</i> information about the underlying gene content or resistance phenotypes of the strains, enabling the possibility to identify AMR determinants and rapidly diagnose and prioritize antibiotic use directly from the organism sequence. Employing such tools to diagnose and limit the spread of resistance-conferring mechanisms could help ameliorate the looming antibiotic resistance crisis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30467523,gganatogram: An R package for modular visualisation of anatograms and tissues based on ggplot2.,"Displaying data onto anatomical structures is a convenient technique to quickly observe tissue related information. However, drawing tissues is a complex task that requires both expertise in anatomy and the arts. While web based applications exist for displaying gene expression on anatograms, other non-genetic disciplines lack similar tools. Moreover, web based tools often lack the modularity associated with packages in programming languages, such as R. Here I present gganatogram, an R package used to plot modular species anatograms based on a combination of the graphical grammar of ggplot2 and the publicly available anatograms from the Expression Atlas. This combination allows for quick and easy, modular, and reproducible generation of anatograms. Using only one command and a data frame with tissue name, group, colour, and value, this tool enables the user to visualise specific human and mouse tissues with desired colours, grouped by a variable, or displaying a desired value, such as gene-expression, pharmacokinetics, or bacterial load across selected tissues. gganatogram consists of 5 highly annotated organisms, male/female human/mouse, and a cell anatogram. It further consists of 24 other less annotated organisms from the animal and plant kingdom. I hope that this tool will be useful by the wider community in biological sciences. Community members are welcome to submit additional anatograms, which can be incorporated into the package. A stable version gganatogram has been deposited to neuroconductor, and a development version can be found on github/jespermaag/gganatogram. An interactive shiny app of gganatogram can be found on https://jespermaag.shinyapps.io/gganatogram/, which allows for non-R users to create anatograms.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

30476000,Integrate multiple traits to detect novel trait-gene association using GWAS summary data with an adaptive test approach.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genetics hold great promise to precision medicine by tailoring treatment to the individual patient based on their genetic profiles. Toward this goal, many large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in the last decade to identify genetic variants associated with various traits and diseases. They have successfully identified tens of thousands of disease-related variants. However they have explained only a small proportion of the overall trait heritability for most traits and are of very limited clinical use. This is partly owing to the small effect sizes of most genetic variants, and the common practice of testing association between one trait and one genetic variant at a time in most GWAS, even when multiple related traits are often measured for each individual. Increasing evidence suggests that many genetic variants can influence multiple traits simultaneously, and we can gain more power by testing association of multiple traits simultaneously. It is appealing to develop novel multi-trait association test methods that need only GWAS summary data, since it is generally very hard to access the individual-level GWAS phenotype and genotype data.<h4>Results</h4>Many existing GWAS summary data-based association test methods have relied on ad hoc approach or crude Monte Carlo approximation. In this article, we develop rigorous statistical methods for efficient and powerful multi-trait association test. We develop robust and efficient methods to accurately estimate the marginal trait correlation matrix using only GWAS summary data. We construct the principal component (PC)-based association test from the summary statistics. PC-based test has optimal power when the underlying multi-trait signal can be captured by the first PC, and otherwise it will have suboptimal performance. We develop an adaptive test by optimally weighting the PC-based test and the omnibus chi-square test to achieve robust performance under various scenarios. We develop efficient numerical algorithms to compute the analytical P-values for all the proposed tests without the need of Monte Carlo sampling. We illustrate the utility of proposed methods through application to the GWAS meta-analysis summary data for multiple lipids and glycemic traits. We identify multiple novel loci that were missed by individual trait-based association test.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All the proposed methods are implemented in an R package available at http://www.github.com/baolinwu/MTAR. The developed R programs are extremely efficient: it takes less than 2 min to compute the list of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for all proposed multi-trait tests for the lipids GWAS summary data with 2.5 million SNPs on a single Linux desktop.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

30560246,Glioma and Alzheimer's Disease.,"Background:Cancer mortality and Alzheimer's disease (AD) mortality increase with age, but some studies have shown an inverse relationship of the two diseases, that is, older persons with cancer have a reduced risk of AD and vice versa. However, other analyses suggest that AD and brain tumor might be positively correlated. Objective:In the current study, we wished to determine the relationship of AD mortality to malignant brain tumor mortality in US states and counties. Methods:Data and maps of malignant brain tumor mortality and Alzheimer's disease mortality (1999-2016) are from the CDC Wonder tool (https://wonder.cdc.gov/cmf-icd10.html). Data on malignant brain tumor types and their frequencies are from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER, https://seer.cancer.gov). Data on the genetics of lower grade glioma are from the TCGA Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) dataset in TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas). Results:SEER data indicate that astrocytomas make up 58.2% of malignant brain tumors in patients 65 and older; glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma make up 41.6%. We found a significant positive correlation between AD mortality rate and malignant brain tumor mortality rate 1999-2016 in persons age 65 and older in A) 1,101 US counties, p <  0.001 and B) 50 US states, p <  0.001. Conclusion:Adult malignant brain tumors may share some environmental risks with AD. Malignant brain tumors and AD also have some genes in common: TREM2, SPI1, CD33, and INPP5D. The interaction of environment and genetics is complex and overlaps in malignant brain tumors and AD.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource
30567473,Cloud-BS: A MapReduce-based bisulfite sequencing aligner on cloud.,"In recent years, there have been many studies utilizing DNA methylome data to answer fundamental biological questions. Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) has enabled measurement of a genome-wide absolute level of DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution. However, due to the ambiguity introduced by bisulfite-treatment, the aligning process especially in large-scale epigenetic research is still considered a huge burden. We present Cloud-BS, an efficient BS-seq aligner designed for parallel execution on a distributed environment. Utilizing Apache Hadoop framework, Cloud-BS splits sequencing reads into multiple blocks and transfers them to distributed nodes. By designing each aligning procedure into separate map and reducing tasks while an internal key-value structure is optimized based on the MapReduce programming model, the algorithm significantly improves alignment performance without sacrificing mapping accuracy. In addition, Cloud-BS minimizes the innate burden of configuring a distributed environment by providing a pre-configured cloud image. Cloud-BS shows significantly improved bisulfite alignment performance compared to other existing BS-seq aligners. We believe our algorithm facilitates large-scale methylome data analysis. The algorithm is freely available at https://paryoja.github.io/Cloud-BS/ .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30572878,"Geographical mobility of UK trainee doctors, from family home to first job: a national cohort study.","<h4>Background</h4>The UK faces geographical variation in the recruitment of doctors. Understanding where medical graduates choose to go for training is important because doctors are more likely to consider practicing in areas where they completed postgraduate training. The wider literature also suggests that there is a relationship between origin and background, and where doctors wish to train/work. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the geographical mobility of UK medical graduates from different socio-economic groups in terms of where they wish to spend their first years of postgraduate training.<h4>Methods</h4>This was an observational study of Foundation Programme (FP) doctors who graduated from 33 UK medical schools between 2012 and 2014. Data was accessed via the UK medical education database (UKMED: https://www.ukmed.ac.uk/ ). Chi-square tests were used to examine the relationships between doctor's sociodemographic characteristics and the dependent variable, average driving time from parental home to foundation school/region. Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to estimate the effects of those factors in combination against the outcome measure.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of doctors prefer to train at foundation schools that are reasonably close to the family home. Those who attended state-funded schools, from non-white ethnic groups and/or from lower socio-economic groups were significantly more likely to choose foundation schools nearer their parental home. Doctors from disadvantaged backgrounds (as determined by entitlement to free school meals, OR = 1.29, p= 0.003 and no parental degree, OR = 1.34, p< 0.001) were associated with higher odds of selecting a foundation schools that were closer to parental home.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The data suggests that recruiting medical students from lower socioeconomic groups and those who originate from under-recruiting areas may be at least part of the solution to filling training posts in these areas. This has obvious implications for the widening access agenda, and equitable distribution of health services.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30578582,Sex differences in the circulatory responses to an isocapnic cold pressor test.,"<h4>New findings</h4>What is the central question of this study? Do sex differences exist in the cardiorespiratory responses to an isocapnic cold pressor test (CPT)? What is the main finding and its importance? During the CPT, there were no sex differences in the respiratory response; however, females demonstrated a reduced mean arterial pressure and reduced dilatation of the common carotid artery. Given that the CPT is predictive of future cardiovascular events, these data have clinical implications for improving the utility of the CPT to determine cardiovascular health risk. Sex differences should be taken into consideration when conducting and interpreting a CPT.<h4>Abstract</h4>The cold pressor test (CPT) elicits a transient increase in sympathetic nervous activity, minute ventilation ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> ), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and common carotid artery (CCA) diameter in healthy individuals. Although the extent of dilatation of the CCA in response to the CPT has been used as a clinical indicator of cardiovascular health status, the potential sex differences have yet to be explored. In response to a CPT, we hypothesized that elevations in <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> and MAP and dilatation of the CCA would be attenuated in females compared with males. In 20 young, healthy participants (10 females), we measured the respiratory, cardiovascular and CCA responses during a CPT, which consisted of a 3min immersion of the right foot into 0-1 ice water. Blood pressure (via finger photoplethysmography), heart rate (via electrocardiogram) and CCA diameter and velocity (via Duplex ultrasound) were simultaneously recorded immediately before and during the CPT. During the CPT, while controlling end-tidal gases to baseline values, the main findings were as follows: (i) no sex differences were present in absolute or relative changes in <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> (P=0.801 and P=0.179, respectively); (ii) the relative MAP and CCA diameter response were reduced in females by 51 and 55%, respectively (P=0.008 and P=0.029versus males, respectively); and (iii) the relative MAP responses was positively correlated with the dilatation of the CCA in males (r=0.42, P=0.019), in females (r=0.43, P=0.019) and in males and females combined (r=0.55, P<0.001). Given that the CPT is used as a clinical tool to assess cardiovascular health status, sex differences should be considered in future studies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30591010,DLAD4U: deriving and prioritizing disease lists from PubMed literature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Due to recent technology advancements, disease related knowledge is growing rapidly. It becomes nontrivial to go through all published literature to identify associations between human diseases and genetic, environmental, and life style factors, disease symptoms, and treatment strategies. Here we report DLAD4U (Disease List Automatically Derived For You), an efficient, accurate and easy-to-use disease search engine based on PubMed literature.<h4>Results</h4>DLAD4U uses the eSearch and eFetch APIs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to find publications related to a query and to identify diseases from the retrieved publications. The hypergeometric test was used to prioritize identified diseases for displaying to users. DLAD4U accepts any valid queries for PubMed, and the output results include a ranked disease list, information associated with each disease, chronologically-ordered supporting publications, a summary of the run, and links for file export. DLAD4U outperformed other disease search engines in our comparative evaluation using selected genes and drugs as query terms and manually curated data as """"gold standard"""". For 100 genes that are associated with only one disease in the gold standard, the Mean Average Precision (MAP) measure from DLAD4U was 0.77, which clearly outperformed other tools. For 10 genes that are associated with multiple diseases in the gold standard, the mean precision, recall and F-measure scores from DLAD4U were always higher than those from other tools. The superior performance of DLAD4U was further confirmed using 100 drugs as queries, with an MAP of 0.90.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DLAD4U is a new, intuitive disease search engine that takes advantage of existing resources at NCBI to provide computational efficiency and uses statistical analyses to ensure accuracy. DLAD4U is publicly available at http://dlad4u.zhang-lab.org .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30611208,Development and validation of a risk score to predict mortality during TB treatment in patients with TB-diabetes comorbidity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Making an accurate prognosis for mortality during tuberculosis (TB) treatment in TB-diabetes (TB-DM) comorbid patients remains a challenge for health professionals, especially in low TB prevalent populations, due to the lack of a standardized prognostic model.<h4>Methods</h4>Using de-identified data from TB-DM patients from Texas, who received TB treatment had a treatment outcome of completed treatment or died before completion, reported to the National TB Surveillance System from January 2010-December 2016, we developed and internally validated a mortality scoring system, based on the regression coefficients.<h4>Results</h4>Of 1227 included TB-DM patients, 112 (9.1%) died during treatment. The score used nine characteristics routinely collected by most TB programs. Patients were divided into three groups based on their score: low-risk (< 12 points), medium-risk (12-21 points) and high-risk (=22 points). The model had good performance (with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.83 in development and 0.82 in validation), and good calibration. A practical mobile calculator app was also created ( https://oaa.app.link/Isqia5rN6K ).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using demographic and clinical characteristics which are available from most TB programs at the patient's initial visits, our simple scoring system had good performance and may be a practical clinical tool for TB health professionals in identifying TB-DM comorbid patients with a high mortality risk.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30662564,Artificial intelligence-based decision-making for age-related macular degeneration.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has a great potential to enhance medical workflow and improve health care quality. Of particular interest is practical implementation of such AI-based software as a cloud-based tool aimed for telemedicine, the practice of providing medical care from a distance using electronic interfaces. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we used a dataset of labeled 35,900 optical coherence tomography (OCT) images obtained from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients and used them to train three types of CNNs to perform AMD diagnosis. <b>Results:</b> Here, we present an AI- and cloud-based telemedicine interaction tool for diagnosis and proposed treatment of AMD. Through deep learning process based on the analysis of preprocessed optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging data, our AI-based system achieved the same image discrimination rate as that of retinal specialists in our hospital. The AI platform's detection accuracy was generally higher than 90% and was significantly superior (p < 0.001) to that of medical students (69.4% and 68.9%) and equal (p = 0.99) to that of retinal specialists (92.73% and 91.90%). Furthermore, it provided appropriate treatment recommendations comparable to those of retinal specialists. <b>Conclusions:</b> We therefore developed a website for realistic cloud computing based on this AI platform, available at https://www.ym.edu.tw/~AI-OCT/. Patients can upload their OCT images to the website to verify whether they have AMD and require treatment. Using an AI-based cloud service represents a real solution for medical imaging diagnostics and telemedicine.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30687361,PolyMorphPredict: A Universal Web-Tool for Rapid Polymorphic Microsatellite Marker Discovery From Whole Genome and Transcriptome Data.,"Microsatellites are ubiquitously distributed, polymorphic repeat sequence valuable for association, selection, population structure and identification. They can be mined by genomic library, probe hybridization and sequencing of selected clones. Such approach has many limitations like biased hybridization and selection of larger repeats. In silico mining of polymorphic markers using data of various genotypes can be rapid and economical. Available tools lack in some or other aspects like: targeted user defined primer generation, polymorphism discovery using multiple sequence, size and number limits of input sequence, no option for primer generation and e-PCR evaluation, transferability, lack of complete automation and user-friendliness. They also lack the provision to evaluate published primers in e-PCR mode to generate additional allelic data using re-sequenced data of various genotypes for judicious utilization of previously generated data. We developed the tool (PolyMorphPredict) using Perl, R, Java and launched at Apache which is available at http://webtom.cabgrid.res.in/polypred/. It mines microsatellite loci and computes primers from genome/transcriptome data of any species. It can perform e-PCR using published primers for polymorphism discovery and across species transferability of microsatellite loci. Present tool has been evaluated using five species of different genome size having 21 genotypes. Though server is equipped with genomic data of three species for test run with gel simulation, but can be used for any species. Further, polymorphism predictability has been validated using in silico and in vitro PCR of four rice genotypes. This tool can accelerate the in silico microsatellite polymorphism discovery in re-sequencing projects of any species of plant and animal for their diversity estimation along with variety/breed identification, population structure, MAS, QTL and gene discovery, traceability, parentage testing, fungal diagnostics and genome finishing.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30701134,"Prognostic values of GMPS, PR, CD40, and p21 in ovarian cancer.","Early detection and prediction of prognosis and treatment responses are all the keys in improving survival of ovarian cancer patients. This study profiled an ovarian cancer progression model to identify prognostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer patients. Mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSECs) can undergo spontaneous malignant transformation in vitro cell culture. These were used as a model of ovarian cancer progression for alterations in gene expression and signaling detected using the Illumina HiSeq2000 Next-Generation Sequencing platform and bioinformatical analyses. The differential expression of four selected genes was identified using the gene expression profiling interaction analysis (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/) and then associated with survival in ovarian cancer patients using the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset and the online Kaplan-Meier Plotter (http://www.kmplot.com) data. The data showed 263 aberrantly expressed genes, including 182 up-regulated and 81 down-regulated genes between the early and late stages of tumor progression in MOSECs. The bioinformatic data revealed four genes (i.e., guanosine 5'-monophosphate synthase (GMPS), progesterone receptor (PR), CD40, and p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A)) to play an important role in ovarian cancer progression. Furthermore, the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset validated the differential expression of these four genes, which were associated with prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. In conclusion, this study profiled differentially expressed genes using the ovarian cancer progression model and identified four (i.e., GMPS, PR, CD40, and p21) as prognostic markers for ovarian cancer patients. Future studies of prospective patients could further verify the clinical usefulness of this four-gene signature.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30708525,First Report of Impatiens Downy Mildew Outbreaks Caused by Plasmopara obducens Throughout the Hawai'ian Islands.,"Downy mildew of impatiens (Impatiens walleriana Hook.f.) was first reported from the continental United States in 2004. In 2011 to 2012, severe and widespread outbreaks were documented across the United States mainland, resulting in considerable economic losses. On May 5, 2013, downy mildew disease symptoms were observed from I. walleriana 'Super Elfin' at a retail nursery in Mililani, on the Hawai'ian island of Oahu. Throughout May and June 2013, additional sightings of the disease were documented from the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Maui, and Hawai'i from nurseries, home gardens, and botanical park and landscape plantings. Symptoms of infected plants initially showed downward leaf curl, followed by a stippled chlorotic appearance on the adaxial leaf surfaces. Abaxial leaf surfaces were covered with a layer of white mycelia. Affected plants exhibited defoliation, flower drop, and stem rot as the disease progressed. Based on morphological and molecular data, the organism was identified as Plasmopara obducens (J. Schrt.) J. Schrt. Microscopic observation disclosed coenocytic mycelium and hyaline, thin-walled, tree-like (monopodial branches), straight, 94.0 to 300.0  3.2 to 10.8 m sporangiophores. Ovoid, hyaline sporangia measuring 11.0 to 14.6  12.2 to 16.2 (average 13.2  14.7) m were borne on sterigma tips of rigid branchlets (8.0 to 15.0 m) at right angle to the main axis of the sporangiophores (1,3). Molecular identification of the pathogen was conducted by removing hyphae from the surface of three heavily infected leaves using sterile tweezers, then extracting DNA using the QIAGEN Plant DNA kit (QIAGEN, Gaithersburg, MD). The nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer was sequenced from each of the three samples bidirectionally from Illustra EXOStar (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) purified amplicon generated from primers ITS1-O and LR-0R (4). Resultant sequences (GenBank KF366378 to 80) shared 99 to 100% nucleotide identity with P. obducens accession DQ665666 (4). A voucher specimen (BPI892676) was deposited in the U.S. National Fungus Collections, Beltsville, MD. Pathogenicity tests were performed by spraying 6-week-old impatiens plants (I. walleriana var. Super Elfin) grown singly in 4-inch pots with a suspension of 1  10<sup>4</sup> P. obducens sporangia/ml until runoff using a handheld atomizer. Control plants were sprayed with distilled water. The plants were kept in high humidity by covering with black plastic bags for 48 h at 20C, and then maintained in the greenhouse (night/day temperature of 20/24C). The first symptoms (downward curling and chlorotic stippling of leaves) and sporulation of the pathogen on under-leaf surfaces of the inoculated plants appeared at 10 days and 21 days after inoculation, respectively. Control plants remained healthy. Morphological features and measurements matched those of the original inoculum, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of downy mildew on I. walleriana in Hawai'i (2). The disease appears to be widespread throughout the islands and is likely to cause considerable losses in Hawai'ian landscapes and production settings. References: (1) O. Constantinescu.

30714121,The histidine decarboxylase model of tic pathophysiology: a new focus on the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor.,"Histamine dysregulation was implicated as a rare cause of Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders a decade ago by a landmark genetic study in a high density family pedigree, which implicated a hypomorphic mutation in the histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) gene as a rare but high penetrance genetic cause. Studies in Hdc knockout (KO) mice have confirmed that this mutation causes tic-relevant behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities that parallel what is seen in patients and thus validate the KO as a potentially informative model of tic pathophysiology. Recent studies have focused on the potential role of the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor in this model, and by association in tic disorders and related neuropsychiatric conditions. The H<sub>3</sub> receptor is up-regulated in the striatum in Hdc KO mice. As the H<sub>3</sub> receptor has constitutive activity in the absence of ligand, this receptor up-regulation may have significant cellular effects despite the absence of neurotransmitter histamine in these mice. Activation in vivo of H<sub>3</sub> receptors in wild type mice regulates signalling in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that interacts non-linearly with dopamine receptor signalling. Baseline signalling alterations in MSNs in Hdc KO mice resemble those seen after H<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist treatment in wild type animals. H<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist treatment in the KOs further accentuates most of these signalling abnormalities and produces behavioural stereotypy. Together, these data suggest the intriguing hypothesis that constitutive signalling by up-regulated H<sub>3</sub> receptors explains many of the molecular and behavioural abnormalities seen in these animals.

30722515,"First Report of Globisporangium ultimum Causing Pythium Damping-Off on Aleppo Pine in Algeria, Africa, and the Mediterranean Region.","Globisporangium ultimum (Trow) Uzuhashi, Tojo & Kakish. (syn. Pythium ultimum Trow, syn. P. ultimum Trow var. ultimum) is a known oomycetal species from Pythium s.l. causing damping-off and/or root rot on a great variety of plants throughout the world, including some pine species (Pinus L.) and conifers (2,3). Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) is a common native forest tree in the Mediterranean region. Pre- and post-emergence damping-off disease symptoms were observed during 2008 and 2009 in four forest nurseries from northwestern Algeria (Relizane, Sidi Belabes, and Tlemcen departments). This disease occurred under cool conditions, and Aleppo pines were significantly affected, reducing seedling emergence. Disinfected segments, about 5 mm in length, from decayed root and collar, were cultured on CMA at 25C. This oomycetal species was identified based on the species description in Pythium keys (3,4). For the molecular identification, PCR was used to amplify the ITS region of Pythium isolates. It was amplified with the flanking primers ITS1 and ITS4, and these products were directly sequenced. Sequence data were compared to known sequences deposited in the NCBI non redundant database to confirm morphological identification. A BLAST search identified U3CR, U7CR, U1RT, U2CR, U4CR, U14CR, U7RT, and U17RT isolates (GenBank Accession Nos. JX191921, 22, 27, 29, 31, and 33 to 35, respectively) as G. ultimum based on 100% similarity with corresponding sequence of the reference isolate no. UZ056 MAFF240024 (AB468781) (3). Phytopathogenicity testing was conducted in a petri dish and pot experiment. In the petri dish experiment, a 3 mm diameter plug was transferred from a 7-day-old CMA colony to the center of a CMA petri dish, with three replicates per isolate, and three control plates were inoculated with sterile agar plugs. After 72 h, 10 Aleppo pine seeds were placed equally spaced to 1 cm from the edge of each plug. After 7 days at 22C in the dark, germination inhibition (46.1 to 87.6%) and root growth inhibition (62.3 to 92.2%) were calculated. In the control plates, germination failure (13.4%) and root length (27.7 cm) were observed. For the pot experiment, inocula were produced by adding a 5 mm diameter plug from a 7-day-old CMA culture to a previously sterilized 500 ml flask containing 237.5 g sand, 12.5 g cornmeal, and 80 ml SDW. Nine-day-old inoculum was mixed with sterile soil at a rate of 1:3 (v:v). Inoculum was transferred to 500 ml pot, and 10 Aleppo pine seeds were planted, with three replicates per isolate, and three control pots were used. After 2 weeks, all of the isolates tested caused typical symptoms of Aleppo pine Pythium damping-off, the percentage of inoculated plants that became infected was 36.6 to 83.3%. In the control pots, no infected plants were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of G. ultimum causing damping-off on Aleppo pine in Algeria, Africa, and the Mediterranean Region.

30722630,First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Erysiphe platani on Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) in South Korea.,"Platanus occidentalis L. (sycamore) is an important shade tree distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and in South Korea. It has been widely used as an ornamental tree, especially in urban regions and by roadsides. The average rate of roadside planting throughout South Korea covers about 5.7% (up to 38% in Seoul), equivalent to 0.36 million trees. In early July 2012, after a rainy spell in summer, an outbreak of powdery mildew on sycamore was first observed on roadside trees in Gwangju, a southern province of South Korea. A more extensive nationwide survey revealed no powdery mildew in northern or central regions of South Korea. The disease has spread rapidly within Gwangju, even though fungicide applications were carried out after the rainy spell. Major symptoms included white, superficial mycelia, grey to brown lesions on the surface of the leaves due to the presence of a hyperparasite (tentatively identified as Ampelomyces sp.), a slight chlorosis, and severe leaf distortion followed by defoliation. Conidiophores were produced singly, straight, and unbranched, with lengths of 35.2 to 315.2 m (average 170.4 m). Conidia were ellipsoid or doliiform, ranging in size from 34.9 to 47.4 m (average 38.2 m) long  16.5 to 26.8 m (average 23.9 m) wide. Primary conidia had a truncate base and rounded apex; secondary conidia had both a truncate base and apex. The conidial outer surface had a reticulated wrinkling. Cleistothecia (i.e., sexual spore structures) were not found during the survey, which extended from July to October. These characteristics and the host species match those of Microsphaera platani (syn. Erysiphe platani), which was described on P. occidentalis in Washington State (2). Fungal rDNA was amplified using primers ITS1 and LR5F (4) for one sample (EML-PLA1, GenBank JX485651). BLASTn searches of GenBank revealed high sequence identity to E. platani (99.5% to JQ365943 and 99.3% to JQ365940). Recently, Liang et al. (3) reported the first occurrence of powdery mildew by E. platani on P. orientalis in China based only on its morphology. Thus, in this study, author could only use ITS sequence data from the United States and Europe to characterize the isolate. To date, nine records of powdery mildews of Platanus spp. have been reported worldwide: on P. hispanica from Brazil, Japan, Hungary, and Slovakia; P. orientalis from Israel; P. racemosa from the United States; P.  acerifolia from the United Kingdom and Germany; and Platanus sp. from Argentina and Australia (1). Interestingly, the hyperparasite, Ampelomyces sp., was found with E. platani, suggesting that there may be some level of biocontrol in nature. Pathogenicity was confirmed by gently pressing diseased leaves onto six leaves of healthy sycamore plants in the field in September. The treated leaves were sealed in sterilized vinyl pack to maintain humid condition for 2 days. Similar symptoms were observed on the inoculated leaves 10 days after inoculation. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by re-observing the fungal pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by E. platani on sycamore in South Korea. References: (1) D.

30783000,Doravirine and the Potential for CYP3A-Mediated Drug-Drug Interactions.,"Identifying and understanding potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are vital for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. This article discusses DDIs between doravirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) substrates and drugs that modulate CYP3A activity. Consistent with previously published <i>in vitro</i> data and DDI trials with the CYP3A substrates midazolam and atorvastatin, doravirine did not have any meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A substrates ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. Coadministration of doravirine with CYP3A inhibitors (ritonavir or ketoconazole) increased doravirine exposure approximately 3-fold. However, these increases were not considered clinically meaningful. Conversely, previously published trials showed that coadministered CYP3A inducers (rifampin and rifabutin) decreased doravirine exposure by 88% and 50%, respectively (K. L. Yee, S. G. Khalilieh, R. I. Sanchez, R. Liu, et al., Clin Drug Investig 37:659-667, 2017 [https://doi.org/10.1007/s40261-017-0513-4]; S. G. Khalilieh, K. L. Yee, R. I. Sanchez, R. Liu, et al., J Clin Pharmacol 58:1044-1052, 2018 [https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1103]), while doravirine exposure following prior efavirenz administration led to an initial reduction in doravirine exposure of 62%, but the reduction became less pronounced with time (K. L. Yee, R. I. Sanchez, P. Auger, R. Liu, et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother 61:e01757-16, 2017 [https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.01757-16]). Overall, the coadministration of doravirine with CYP3A inhibitors and substrates is, therefore, supported by these data together with efficacy and safety data from clinical trials, while coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, cannot be recommended. Concomitant dosing with rifabutin (a CYP3A inducer less potent than rifampin) is acceptable if doravirine dosing is adjusted from once to twice daily; however, the effect of other moderate inducers on doravirine pharmacokinetics is unknown.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30832735,Ultrasound Elastography supplement assessing nodal status of magnetic resonance imaging staged cervical N0 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"<h4>Background</h4>To determine whether ultrasound elastography can distinguish reactive or metastatic small lymph nodes (sLN) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staged cervical N0 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).<h4>Methods</h4>A pilot study was performed involving the diagnostic performances of conventional high-frequency ultrasound (CHFU) and/or shear wave elastography (SWE) for predicting metastases in sLN of MRI-staged N0 NPC patients with reference to the histologically-proven ultrasound guided core needle biopsy (US-CNB). The diagnosis of CHFU was based on the superficial lymph node ultrasonic criteria with the five-point-scale (FPS). The mean (Emean), minimum (Emin) and maximum (Emax) of the elasticity indices were measured by SWE at the stiffest part of the sLN in kilopascal. Diagnostic performances were analyzed using a receiver operating curve (ROC) on a per-node basis. The authenticity of this article has been validated by uploading the key raw data onto the Research Data Deposit public platform ( http://www.researchdata.org.cn ), with the approval RDD number as RDDA2017000447.<h4>Results</h4>All 113 cervical sLN of 49 MRI-staged cervical N0 NPC patients underwent evaluation of CHFU and SWE; 38 sLN (FPS < 2) were regarded as benign, which were excluded from subsequent analysis due to none biopsy-proven. And 75 indeterminate sLN (FPS=2) were referred to US-CNB and revealed 15 (20%) metastases. All SWE elastic indices were significantly higher in malignant sLNs than in benign sLNs (p< 0.05). Moreover, Emax exhibited the highest diagnostic value (AUC:0.733  0.067, p= 0.005) with excellent measurement reproducibility (ICC: 0.786; 95%CI: 0.684, 0.864). CHFU plus SWE was superior to CHFU or SWE alone for predicting metastases in sLN of MRI-staged N0 patients with NPC (p< 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>CHFU plus SWE is an optional non-invasive modality to supplement MRI in assessing cervical nodal status of patients with NPC.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data deposited as referenced

30867992,Lightweight data management with dtool.,"The explosion in volumes and types of data has led to substantial challenges in data management. These challenges are often faced by front-line researchers who are already dealing with rapidly changing technologies and have limited time to devote to data management. There are good high-level guidelines for managing and processing scientific data. However, there is a lack of simple, practical tools to implement these guidelines. This is particularly problematic in a highly distributed research environment where needs differ substantially from group to group and centralised solutions are difficult to implement and storage technologies change rapidly. To meet these challenges we have developed dtool, a command line tool for managing data. The tool packages data and metadata into a unified whole, which we call a dataset. The dataset provides consistency checking and the ability to access metadata for both the whole dataset and individual files. The tool can store these datasets on several different storage systems, including a traditional file system, object store (S3 and Azure) and iRODS. It includes an application programming interface that can be used to incorporate it into existing pipelines and workflows. The tool has provided substantial process, cost, and peace-of-mind benefits to our data management practices and we want to share these benefits. The tool is open source and available freely online at http://dtool.readthedocs.io.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

30918038,Relationship between sociodemographic factors and specialty destination of UK trainee doctors: a national cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES:Many countries are driving forward policies to widen the socioeconomic profile of medical students and to train more medical students for certain specialties. However, little is known about how socioeconomic origin relates to specialty choice. Nor is there a good understanding of the relationship between academic performance and specialty choice. To address these gaps, our aim was to identify the relationship between socioeconomic background, academic performance and accepted offers into specialty training. DESIGN:Longitudinal, cohort study using data from the UK Medical Education Database (https://www.ukmed.ac.uk/). PARTICIPANTS:6065 (60% females) UK doctors who accepted offers to a specialty training (residency) post after completing the 2-year generic foundation programme (UK Foundation Programme) between 2012 and 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:<U+03A7>2 tests were used to examine the relationships between sociodemographic characteristics, academic ability and the dependent variable, specialty choice. Multiple data imputation was used to address the issue of missing data. Multinomial regression was employed to test the independent variables in predicting the likelihood of choosing a given specialty. RESULTS:Participants pursuing careers in more competitive specialties had significantly higher academic scores than colleagues pursuing less competitive ones. After controlling for the presence of multiple factors, trainees who came from families where no parent was educated to a degree level had statistically significant lower odds of choosing careers in medical specialties relative to general practice (OR=0.78, 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.92). Students who entered medical school as school leavers, compared with mature students, had odds 1.2 times higher (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.56) of choosing surgical specialties than general practice. CONCLUSIONS:The data indicate a direct association between trainees' sociodemographic characteristics, academic ability and career choices. The findings can be used by medical school, training boards and workforce planners to inform recruitment and retention strategies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30967119,Large-scale 3D chromatin reconstruction from chromosomal contacts.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent advances in genome analysis have established that chromatin has preferred 3D conformations, which bring distant loci into contact. Identifying these contacts is important for us to understand possible interactions between these loci. This has motivated the creation of the Hi-C technology, which detects long-range chromosomal interactions. Distance geometry-based algorithms, such as ChromSDE and ShRec3D, have been able to utilize Hi-C data to infer 3D chromosomal structures. However, these algorithms, being matrix-based, are space- and time-consuming on very large datasets. A human genome of 100 kilobase resolution would involve ~30,000 loci, requiring gigabytes just in storing the matrices.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a succinct representation of the distance matrices which tremendously reduces the space requirement. We give a complete solution, called SuperRec, for the inference of chromosomal structures from Hi-C data, through iterative solving the large-scale weighted multidimensional scaling problem.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SuperRec runs faster than earlier systems without compromising on result accuracy.

Probabilities of care completion (Pcc) were calculated for pediatric (<18 years old) and adult conditions in all acute-care hospitals in each state. Using the Pcc, we constructed interactive heatmap visualizations for direct comparison of pediatric and adult hospital care systems.<h4>Results</h4>On average, across the 7 states, 70.6% of all hospitals had Pcc >0.5 for more than half of all adult conditions, whereas <14.9% of hospitals had Pcc >0.1 for half of pediatric conditions. Visualizations revealed wide variation among states with clearly apparent institutional dependencies and condition-specific gaps (full interactive versions are available at https://goo.gl/5t8vAw).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The functional disparities between pediatric and adult hospital care systems are substantial, and condition-specific differences should be considered in reimbursement strategies, disaster planning, network adequacy determinations, and public health planning.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
30989232,Long-term Clinical Effectiveness of Ustekinumab in Patients with Crohn's Disease Who Failed Biologic Therapies: A National Cohort Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Ustekinumab [UST] was recently approved in Europe for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease [CD]. Long-term real-world data are currently scarce for CD patients previously exposed to several biologics.<h4>Methods</h4>This is an observational, national, retrospective multicentre study. Patients received intravenous UST ~6 mg/kg at baseline, with 90 mg subcutaneously thereafter every 8 weeks. Response and remission rates were assessed at Weeks 8, 16, and 52.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 152 patients were analysed. All patients were exposed to at least one anti-TNFa agent, with 69.7% were exposed to even two anti-TNFa and vedolizumab. After 1 year, 42.1% and 25.7% of patients had experienced clinical response and clinical remission, respectively, and 38.8% and 24.3% had achieved steroid-free clinical response and remission, respectively; 38.8% of patients discontinued therapy during the 12 months of follow-up. Colonic location was predictive of clinical response at 1 year, and low body mass index [BMI] at baseline was a negative predictor of clinical remission. Resolution of arthralgia was associated with clinical response over time. De novo arthralgia was reported by 17.9% of patients at Week 8 and 13.5% of patients at Week 52. No impact of UST on arthralgia was observed in patients with concomitant ankylosing spondylitis [n = 17]. Others adverse events were reported in 7.2% of patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This real-world cohort study confirms the effectiveness of UST in CD patients previously exposed to several biologics. Ustekinumab was well tolerated with respect to adverse events.<h4>Podcast</h4>This article has an associated podcast which can be accessed at https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/pages/podcast.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31001324,BayesPI-BAR2: A New Python Package for Predicting Functional Non-coding Mutations in Cancer Patient Cohorts.,"Most of somatic mutations in cancer occur outside of gene coding regions. These mutations may disrupt the gene regulation by affecting protein-DNA interaction. A study of these disruptions is important in understanding tumorigenesis. However, current computational tools process DNA sequence variants individually, when predicting the effect on protein-DNA binding. Thus, it is a daunting task to identify functional regulatory disturbances among thousands of mutations in a patient. Previously, we have reported and validated a pipeline for identifying functional non-coding somatic mutations in cancer patient cohorts, by integrating diverse information such as gene expression, spatial distribution of the mutations, and a biophysical model for estimating protein binding affinity. Here, we present a new user-friendly Python package BayesPI-BAR2 based on the proposed pipeline for integrative whole-genome sequence analysis. This may be the first prediction package that considers information from both multiple mutations and multiple patients. It is evaluated in follicular lymphoma and skin cancer patients, by focusing on sequence variants in gene promoter regions. BayesPI-BAR2 is a useful tool for predicting functional non-coding mutations in whole genome sequencing data: it allows identification of novel transcription factors (TFs) whose binding is altered by non-coding mutations in cancer. BayesPI-BAR2 program can analyze multiple datasets of genome-wide mutations at once and generate concise, easily interpretable reports for potentially affected gene regulatory sites.

31028388,SEanalysis: a web tool for super-enhancer associated regulatory analysis.,"Super-enhancers (SEs) have prominent roles in biological and pathological processes through their unique transcriptional regulatory capability. To date, several SE databases have been developed by us and others. However, these existing databases do not provide downstream or upstream regulatory analyses of SEs. Pathways, transcription factors (TFs), SEs, and SE-associated genes form complex regulatory networks. Therefore, we designed a novel web server, SEanalysis, which provides comprehensive SE-associated regulatory network analyses. SEanalysis characterizes SE-associated genes, TFs binding to target SEs, and their upstream pathways. The current version of SEanalysis contains more than 330 000 SEs from more than 540 types of cells/tissues, 5042 TF ChIP-seq data generated from these cells/tissues, DNA-binding sequence motifs for ~700 human TFs and 2880 pathways from 10 databases. SEanalysis supports searching by either SEs, samples, TFs, pathways or genes. The complex regulatory networks formed by these factors can be interactively visualized. In addition, we developed a customizable genome browser containing >6000 customizable tracks for visualization.

Since the release of the MSPIP web server in 2015, we have brought significant updates to both the tool and the web server. In addition to the original models for CID and HCD fragmentation, we have added specialized models for the TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer, for TMT-labeled peptides, for iTRAQ-labeled peptides, and for iTRAQ-labeled phosphopeptides. Because the fragmentation pattern is heavily altered in each of these cases, these additional models greatly improve the prediction accuracy for their corresponding data types. We have also substantially reduced the computational resources required to run MSPIP, and have completely rebuilt the web server, which now allows predictions of up to 100 000 peptide sequences in a single request.

31031918,Future temperature and salinity do not exert selection pressure on cyst germination of a toxic phytoplankton species.,"Environmental conditions regulate the germination of phytoplankton resting stages. While some factors lead to synchronous germination, others stimulate germination of only a small fraction of the resting stages. This suggests that habitat filters may act on the germination level and thus affect selection of blooming strains. Benthic """"seed banks"""" of the toxic dinoflagellate <i>Alexandrium ostenfeldii</i> from the Baltic Sea are genetically and phenotypically diverse, indicating a high potential for adaptation by selection on standing genetic variation. Here, we experimentally tested the role of climate-related salinity and temperature as selection filters during germination and subsequent establishment of <i>A.ostenfeldii</i> strains. A representative resting cyst population was isolated from sediment samples, and germination and reciprocal transplantation experiments were carried out, including four treatments: Average present day germination conditions and three potential future conditions: high temperature, low salinity, and high temperature in combination with low salinity. We found that the final germination success of <i>A.ostenfeldii</i> resting cysts was unaffected by temperature and salinity in the range tested. A high germination success of more than 80% in all treatments indicates that strains are not selected by temperature and salinity during germination, but selection becomes more important shortly after germination, in the vegetative stage of the life cycle. Moreover, strains were not adapted to germination conditions. Instead, highly plastic responses occurred after transplantation and significantly higher growth rates were observed at higher temperature. High variability of strain-specific responses has probably masked the overall effect of the treatments, highlighting the importance of testing the effect of environmental factors on many strains. It is likely that <i>A.ostenfeldii</i> populations can persist in the future, because suitable strains, which are able to germinate and grow well at potential future climate conditions, are part of the highly diverse cyst population.<h4>Open research badges</h4>This article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available the digitally-shareable data necessary to reproduce the reported results.

It is the hope that this Guideline becomes a reference for effective evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality database to identify studies indexed between January 2007-September 2017. Following initial publication, this guideline was amended in 2019 and reflects relevant literature published through January 2019. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, https://www.jurology.com).<h4>Results</h4>This Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding management of LUTS/BPH utilizing surgery and minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST). Additional statements are made regarding diagnostic and pre-operative tests. Clinical statements are made in comparison to what is generally accepted as the gold standard (i.e. transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP] monopolar and/or bipolar).

This review details sex differences from animal and human studies in the function of HPA axis elements (glucocorticoids, corticotropin releasing factor, and vasopressin) and related compounds tested as candidate antidepressants. We propose that sex differences contribute to the failure of novel HPA axis-based drugs in clinical trials. Compounds studied preclinically in males were tested in clinical trials that recruited more, if not exclusively, women, and did not control, but rather adjusted, for potential sex differences. Indeed, clinical trials of antidepressants are usually not stratified by sex or other important factors, although preclinical and epidemiological data support such stratification. In conclusion, we suggest that clinical testing of HPA axis-related compounds creates an opportunity for targeted, personalized antidepressant treatments based on sex.

31112088,Using Artificial Intelligence to Revise ACR TI-RADS Risk Stratification of Thyroid Nodules: Diagnostic Accuracy and Utility.,"Background Risk stratification systems for thyroid nodules are often complicated and affected by low specificity. Continual improvement of these systems is necessary to reduce the number of unnecessary thyroid biopsies. Purpose To use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS). Materials and Methods A total of 1425 biopsy-proven thyroid nodules from 1264 consecutive patients (1026 women; mean age, 52.9 years [range, 18-93 years]) were evaluated retrospectively. Expert readers assigned points based on five ACR TI-RADS categories (composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, echogenic foci), and a genetic AI algorithm was applied to a training set (1325 nodules). Point and pathologic data were used to create an optimized scoring system (hereafter, AI TI-RADS). Performance of the systems was compared by using a test set of the final 100 nodules with interpretations from the expert reader, eight nonexpert readers, and an expert panel. Initial performance of AI TI-RADS was calculated by using a test for differences between binomial proportions. Additional comparisons across readers were conducted by using bootstrapping; diagnostic performance was assessed by using area under the receiver operating curve. Results AI TI-RADS assigned new point values for eight ACR TI-RADS features. Six features were assigned zero points, which simplified categorization. By using expert reader data, the diagnostic performance of ACR TI-RADS and AI TI-RADS was area under the receiver operating curve of 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. For the same expert, specificity of AI TI-RADS (65%, 55 of 85) was higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (47%, 40 of 85). For the eight nonexpert radiologists, mean specificity for AI TI-RADS (55%) was also higher (P < .001) than that of ACR TI-RADS (48%). An interactive AI TI-RADS calculator can be viewed at http://deckard.duhs.duke.edu/~ai-ti-rads . Conclusion An artificial intelligence-optimized Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) validates the American College of Radiology TI-RADS while slightly improving specificity and maintaining sensitivity. Additionally, it simplifies feature assignments, which may improve ease of use.  RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31112286,Urinary tract infection prevention after midurethral slings in pelvic floor reconstructive surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION:Synthetic midurethral slings are the most common procedures currently performed for stress urinary incontinence in women. Infection is a frequent complication of urogynecologic surgery. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify interventions that successfully prevent infections, including urinary tract infection (UTI) and/or bacteriuria, compared with no intervention, in women undergoing midurethral sling surgery with or without concomitant pelvic reconstructive procedures for prolapse. MATERIAL AND METHODS:The primary outcome was the development of any infection post-midurethral sling placement in women. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were searched for comparative studies from inception to July 2017, with no language restrictions. We used search terms related to midurethral sling, infections and infection-reduction interventions. Two independent reviewers abstracted data and assessed study quality. Pooled effect size estimates were calculated. We conducted meta-analysis of eligible studies. A protocol for this review has been registered and can be accessed online (http://hdl.handle.net/2429/64731). RESULTS:We identified seven eligible studies of infection risk-reducing interventions; all focused on UTIs. Only one study assessed preoperative antibiotics with midurethral sling alone and was halted early because of low UTI rates. All other studies (three randomized control trials and three observational studies) examined whether postoperative antibiotics decrease UTI/bacteriuria rates after midurethral sling with or without reconstructive procedures for pelvic organ prolapse and using bladder catheterization postoperatively. Due to considerable clinical heterogeneity, we only combined four studies for meta-analysis. Postoperative oral prophylactic nitrofurantoin showed no significant benefit in reducing UTI/bacteriuria in women post-midurethral sling with or without concomitant reconstructive pelvic surgery and the need for bladder catheterization, when compared with the reference group (pooled relative risk 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.25). CONCLUSIONS:Based on the best available evidence, postoperative oral nitrofurantoin is not effective at reducing UTI/bacteriuria rates in catheterized women after midurethral sling with or without concomitant pelvic reconstructive surgery for prolapse. For midurethral sling alone, preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis may not be needed for UTI prevention.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31150060,Augmented Interval List: a novel data structure for efficient genomic interval search.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genomic data is frequently stored as segments or intervals. Because this data type is so common, interval-based comparisons are fundamental to genomic analysis. As the volume of available genomic data grows, developing efficient and scalable methods for searching interval data is necessary.<h4>Results</h4>We present a new data structure, the Augmented Interval List (AIList), to enumerate intersections between a query interval q and an interval set R. An AIList is constructed by first sorting R as a list by the interval start coordinate, then decomposing it into a few approximately flattened components (sublists), and then augmenting each sublist with the running maximum interval end. The query time for AIList is O(log2N+n+m), where n is the number of overlaps between R and q, N is the number of intervals in the set R and m is the average number of extra comparisons required to find the n overlaps. Tested on real genomic interval datasets, AIList code runs 5-18 times faster than standard high-performance code based on augmented interval-trees, nested containment lists or R-trees (BEDTools). For large datasets, the memory-usage for AIList is 4-60% of other methods. The AIList data structure, therefore, provides a significantly improved fundamental operation for highly scalable genomic data analysis.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>An implementation of the AIList data structure with both construction and search algorithms is available at http://ailist.databio.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Most of the current RNA structure alignment programs are built on size-dependent scales, which complicate the interpretation of structure and functional relations. Meanwhile, the low speed prevents the programs from being applied to large-scale RNA structural database search.<h4>Results</h4>We developed an open-source algorithm, RNA-align, for RNA 3D structure alignment which has the structure similarity scaled by a size-independent and statistically interpretable scoring metric. Large-scale benchmark tests show that RNA-align significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art programs in both alignment accuracy and running speed. The major advantage of RNA-align lies at the quick convergence of the heuristic alignment iterations and the coarse-grained secondary structure assignment, both of which are crucial to the speed and accuracy of RNA structure alignments.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/RNA-align/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

(Vochysiaceae) by LC-MS/MS Label-Free Identification in Response to Aluminum.,"This dataset brief is about the descriptive proteome of Qualea grandiflora plants by label free mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Q. grandiflora is a plant that accumulates aluminum (Al) in high quantities and requires it for growth and development. Although quite relevant for the understanding of Al effects on plants, the proteome of Q. grandiflora has not been studied yet. Therefore, the current proteome analysis identifies a total of 2010 proteins.

31173064,RAISS: robust and accurate imputation from summary statistics.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Multi-trait analyses using public summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are becoming increasingly popular. A constraint of multi-trait methods is that they require complete summary data for all traits. Although methods for the imputation of summary statistics exist, they lack precision for genetic variants with small effect size. This is benign for univariate analyses where only variants with large effect size are selected a posteriori. However, it can lead to strong p-value inflation in multi-trait testing. Here we present a new approach that improve the existing imputation methods and reach a precision suitable for multi-trait analyses.<h4>Results</h4>We fine-tuned parameters to obtain a very high accuracy imputation from summary statistics. We demonstrate this accuracy for variants of all effect sizes on real data of 28 GWAS. We implemented the resulting methodology in a python package specially designed to efficiently impute multiple GWAS in parallel.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The python package is available at: https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/statistical-genetics/raiss, its accompanying documentation is accessible here http://statistical-genetics.pages.pasteur.fr/raiss/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31179198,An Emergent Space for Distributed Data with Hidden Internal Order through Manifold Learning.,"Manifold-learning techniques are routinely used in mining complex spatiotemporal data to extract useful, parsimonious data representations/parametrizations; these are, in turn, useful in nonlinear model identification tasks. We focus here on the case of time series data that can ultimately be modelled as a spatially distributed system (e.g. a partial differential equation, PDE), but where we do not know the space in which this PDE should be formulated. Hence, even the spatial coordinates for the distributed system themselves need to be identified - to """"emerge from""""-the data mining process. We will first validate this """"emergent space"""" reconstruction for time series sampled <i>without space labels</i> in known PDEs; this brings up the issue of observability of physical space from temporal observation data, and the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (order-parameter-based) representations by tuning the scale of the data mining kernels. We will then present actual emergent space """"discovery"""" illustrations. Our illustrative examples include chimera states (states of coexisting coherent and incoherent dynamics), and chaotic as well as quasiperiodic spatiotemporal dynamics, arising in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks. We also discuss how data-driven """"spatial"""" coordinates can be extracted in ways invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument. Such gauge-invariant data mining can go beyond the fusion of heterogeneous observations of the same system, to the possible matching of apparently different systems.

31199465,Positive multistate protein design.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Structure-based computational protein design (CPD) plays a critical role in advancing the field of protein engineering. Using an all-atom energy function, CPD tries to identify amino acid sequences that fold into a target structure and ultimately perform a desired function. The usual approach considers a single rigid backbone as a target, which ignores backbone flexibility. Multistate design (MSD) allows instead to consider several backbone states simultaneously, defining challenging computational problems.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce efficient reductions of positive MSD problems to Cost Function Networks with two different fitness definitions and implement them in the Pompd (Positive Multistate Protein design) software. Pompd is able to identify guaranteed optimal sequences of positive multistate full protein redesign problems and exhaustively enumerate suboptimal sequences close to the MSD optimum. Applied to nuclear magnetic resonance and back-rubbed X-ray structures, we observe that the average energy fitness provides the best sequence recovery. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art guaranteed computational design approaches by orders of magnitudes and can solve MSD problems with sizes previously unreachable with guaranteed algorithms.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://forgemia.inra.fr/thomas.schiex/pompd as documented Open Source.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31230988,Baseline characteristics did not identify people with low back pain who respond best to a Movement System Impairment-Based classification treatment.,"<h4>Study design</h4>Secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial.<h4>Background</h4>Treatment based on the Movement System Impairment-Based classification for chronic low back pain results in the same benefit when compared to other forms of exercise. It is possible that participant's characteristics measured at baseline can identify people with chronic low back pain who would respond best to a treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess if specific characteristics of people with chronic low back pain measured at baseline can modify the effects of a treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model on pain and disability.<h4>Methods</h4>Four variables assessed at baseline that could potentially modify the treatment effects of the treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model were selected (age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification). Separate univariate models were used to investigate a possible modifier treatment effect of baseline participant's characteristics on pain and disability after the treatment. Findings of interaction values above 1 point for the outcome mean pain intensity or above 3 points for disability (Roland Morris questionnaire) were considered clinically relevant.<h4>Results</h4>Linear regression analyses for the outcomes of pain and disability did not show interaction values considered clinically relevant for age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification did not modify the effects of an 8-week treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model in patients with chronic low back pain.

31236209,The research crisis in American institutions of complementary and integrative health: one proposed solution for chiropractic profession.,"A crisis confronts the Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) teaching institutions in the US. Research infrastructure is needed to build and sustain productive research programs and retain their own research faculty. In most health professions, this infrastructure is largely built through research grants. In CIH, most educational institutions are funded through student tuition, which has historically also had to be the source for building their research programs. Only a limited number of these institutions have emerged as National Institute of Health (NIH) grant-funded programs. As a result, the American chiropractic institutions have seen a retrenchment in the number of active research programs. In addition, although research training programs e.g., NIH's K awards are available for CIH researchers, these programs generally result in these researchers leaving their institutions and depriving future CIH practitioners of the benefit of being trained in a culture of research. One proposed solution is to leverage the substantial research infrastructure and long history of collaboration available at the RAND Corporation (https://www.rand.org) This article presents the proposed five components of the RAND Center for Collaborative CIH Research and the steps required to bring it to being: 1) the CIH Research Network - an online resource and collaborative site for CIH researchers; 2) the CIH Research Advisory Board - the governing body for the Center selected by its members; 3) the RAND CIH Interest Group - a group of RAND researchers with an interest in and who could provide support to CIH research; 4) CIH Researcher Training - access to existing RAND research training as well as the potential for the Center to provide a research training home for those with training grants; and 5) CIH RAND Partnership for Research - a mentorship program to support successful CIH research. By necessity the first step in the Center's creation would be a meeting between the heads of interested CIH institutions to work out the details and to obtain buy-in. The future success of CIH-directed research on CIH will require a pooling of talent and resources across institutions; something that the American chiropractic institutions have not yet been able to achieve. This article discusses one possible solution.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31250882,Isoform function prediction based on bi-random walks on a heterogeneous network.,"MOTIVATION:Alternative splicing contributes to the functional diversity of protein species and the proteoforms translated from alternatively spliced isoforms of a gene actually execute the biological functions. Computationally predicting the functions of genes has been studied for decades. However, how to distinguish the functional annotations of isoforms, whose annotations are essential for understanding developmental abnormalities and cancers, is rarely explored. The main bottleneck is that functional annotations of isoforms are generally unavailable and functional genomic databases universally store the functional annotations at the gene level. RESULTS:We propose IsoFun to accomplish Isoform Function prediction based on bi-random walks on a heterogeneous network. IsoFun firstly constructs an isoform functional association network based on the expression profiles of isoforms derived from multiple RNA-seq datasets. Next, IsoFun uses the available Gene Ontology annotations of genes, gene-gene interactions and the relations between genes and isoforms to construct a heterogeneous network. After this, IsoFun performs a tailored bi-random walk on the heterogeneous network to predict the association between GO terms and isoforms, thus accomplishing the prediction of GO annotations of isoforms. Experimental results show that IsoFun significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and improves the area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 17% and 44% at the gene-level, respectively. We further validated the performance of IsoFun on the genes ADAM15 and BCL2L1. IsoFun accurately differentiates the functions of respective isoforms of these two genes.

31290545,A curated collection of transcriptome datasets to investigate the molecular mechanisms of immunoglobulin E-mediated atopic diseases.,"Prevalence of allergies has reached ~20% of population in developed countries and sensitization rate to one or more allergens among school age children are approaching 50%. However, the combination of the complexity of atopic allergy susceptibility/development and environmental factors has made identification of gene biomarkers challenging. The amount of publicly accessible transcriptomic data presents an unprecedented opportunity for mechanistic discoveries and validation of complex disease signatures across studies. However, this necessitates structured methodologies and visual tools for the interpretation of results. Here, we present a curated collection of transcriptomic datasets relevant to immunoglobin E-mediated atopic diseases (ranging from allergies to primary immunodeficiencies). Thirty-three datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus, encompassing 1860 transcriptome profiles, were made available on the Gene Expression Browser (GXB), an online and open-source web application that allows for the query, visualization and annotation of metadata. The thematic compositions, disease categories, sample number and platforms of the collection are described. Ranked gene lists and sample grouping are used to facilitate data visualization/interpretation and are available online via GXB (http://ige.gxbsidra.org/dm3/geneBrowser/list).

31296218,Evaluating single-subject study methods for personal transcriptomic interpretations to advance precision medicine.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gene expression profiling has benefited medicine by providing clinically relevant insights at the molecular candidate and systems levels. However, to adopt a more 'precision' approach that integrates individual variability including 'omics data into risk assessments, diagnoses, and therapeutic decision making, whole transcriptome expression needs to be interpreted meaningfully for single subjects. We propose an """"all-against-one"""" framework that uses biological replicates in isogenic conditions for testing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in a single subject (ss) in the absence of an appropriate external reference standard or replicates. To evaluate our proposed """"all-against-one"""" framework, we construct reference standards (RSs) with five conventional replicate-anchored analyses (NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2) and the remainder were treated separately as single-subject sample pairs for ss analyses (without replicates).<h4>Results</h4>Eight ss methods (NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, mixture model, DESeq, DESeq2, iDEG, and ensemble) for identifying genes with differential expression were compared in Yeast (parental line versus snf2 deletion mutant; n= 42/condition) and a MCF7 breast-cancer cell line (baseline versus stimulated with estradiol; n= 7/condition). Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall plots were determined for eight ss methods against each of the five RSs in both datasets. Consistent with prior analyses of these data, ~ 50% and ~ 15% DEGs were obtained in Yeast and MCF7 datasets respectively, regardless of the RSs method. NOISeq, edgeR, and DESeq were the most concordant for creating a RS. Single-subject versions of NOISeq, DEGseq, and an ensemble learner achieved the best median ROC-area-under-the-curve to compare two transcriptomes without replicates regardless of the RS method and dataset (> 90% in Yeast, > 0.75 in MCF7). Further, distinct specific single-subject methods perform better according to different proportions of DEGs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The """"all-against-one"""" framework provides a honest evaluation framework for single-subject DEG studies since these methods are evaluated, by design, against reference standards produced by unrelated DEG methods. The ss-ensemble method was the only one to reliably produce higher accuracies in all conditions tested in this conservative evaluation framework. However, single-subject methods for identifying DEGs from paired samples need improvement, as no method performed with precision> 90% and obtained moderate levels of recall. http://www.lussiergroup.org/publications/EnsembleBiomarker.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31301205,The Generation of a Comprehensive Spectral Library for the Analysis of the Guinea Pig Proteome by SWATH-MS.,"Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry have facilitated the incorporation of proteomic studies to many biology experimental workflows. Data-independent acquisition platforms, such as sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS), offer several advantages for label-free quantitative assessment of complex proteomes over data-dependent acquisition (DDA) approaches. However, SWATH data interpretation requires spectral libraries as a detailed reference resource. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) is an excellent experimental model for translation to many aspects of human physiology and disease, yet there is limited experimental information regarding its proteome. To overcome this knowledge gap, a comprehensive spectral library of the guinea pig proteome is generated. Homogenates and tryptic digests are prepared from 16 tissues and subjected to >200 DDA runs. Analysis of >250000 peptide-spectrum matches resulted in a library of 73594 peptides from 7666 proteins. Library validation is provided by i) analyzing externally derived SWATH files (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2018.03.023) and comparing peptide intensity quantifications; ii) merging of externally derived data to the base library. This furnishes the research community with a comprehensive proteomic resource that will facilitate future molecular-phenotypic studies using (re-engaging) the guinea pig as an experimental model of relevance to human biology.

31307061,PRSice-2: Polygenic Risk Score software for biobank-scale data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses have become an integral part of biomedical research, exploited to gain insights into shared aetiology among traits, to control for genomic profile in experimental studies, and to strengthen causal inference, among a range of applications. Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required.<h4>Results</h4>Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software program for automating and simplifying PRS analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models, and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative PRS software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PRSice-2's combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated, e.g., when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene set-based analyses. PRSice-2 is written in C++, with an R script for plotting, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31333564,Googling Service Boundaries for Endovascular Clot Retrieval (ECR) Hub Hospitals in Metropolitan Sydney.,"<b>Background and Purpose:</b> Endovascular clot retrieval (ECR) has revolutionized acute stroke therapy but is expensive to run and staff with accredited interventional neuroradiologists 24/7; consequently, it is only feasible for each metropolitan city to have a minimum number of hubs that is adequate to service the population. This method is applied to search the minimum number of hospitals to be designated as ECR hubs in Sydney as well as the population at risk of stroke reachable within 30 min. <b>Methods:</b> Traveling time from the centroids of each suburbs to five ECR capable hubs [Royal Prince Alfred/RPA, Prince of Wales/POW, Royal North Shore/RNS, Liverpool/LH and Westmead/WH]. This step was performed using <i>ggmap</i> package in R to interface with Google Map application program interface (API). Next, we calculate the percentage of suburbs within each catchment in which traveling time to the ECR hub is <30 min. This step was performed for all possible combination of ECR hubs. The maps are available at https://gntem3.shinyapps.io/ambsydney/. The population at risk of stroke was estimated using stroke incident studies in Melbourne and Adelaide. <b>Results:</b> The best 3-hospital combinations are LPH/WH/RNS (82.3, 45.7, and 79.7% of suburbs reachable within 30 min or 187 of 226 suburbs) follow by RPA/LPH/RNS (100.0, 80.9, and 73.1% of suburbs) and LPH/POW/RNS (83.3, 90.7, and 76.6% of suburbs). The best 4-hospital model is LPH/WH/POW/RNS (84.2%, 91.1%, 90.7%, 77.8%). In the 5-hospital model, ECR is available for 191 suburbs within 30 min: LPH (83%), RPA (100%), WH (90.2%), RNS (72.7%), POW (88.9%). Based on 3-hospital model and 15% of patient eligible for ECR, the expected number of cases to be handled by each hospital is 465. This number drops down to 374 if a 4-hospital model is preferred. <b>Conclusions:</b> The simulation studies supported a minimum of 4 ECR hubs servicing Sydney. This model provides data on number of suburbs and population at risk of stroke that can reach these hubs within 30 min.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31339576,Transferrin and H-ferritin involvement in brain iron acquisition during postnatal development: impact of sex and genotype.,"Iron delivery to the developing brain is essential for energy and metabolic support needed for processes such as myelination and neuronal development. Iron deficiency, especially in the developing brain, can result in a number of long-term neurological deficits that persist into adulthood. There is considerable debate that excess access to iron during development may result in iron overload in the brain and subsequently predispose individuals to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. There is a significant gap in knowledge regarding how the brain acquires iron during development and how biological variables such as development, genetics, and sex impact brain iron status. In this study, we used a mouse model expressing a mutant form of the iron homeostatic regulator protein HFE, (Hfe H63D), the most common gene variant in Caucasians, to determine impact of the mutation on brain iron uptake. Iron uptake was assessed using <sup>59</sup> Fe bound to either transferrin or H-ferritin as the iron carrier proteins. We demonstrate that at postnatal day 22, mutant mice brains take up greater amounts of iron compared with wildtype. Moreover, we introduce H-ferritin as a key protein in brain iron transport during development and identify a sex and genotype effect demonstrating female mutant mice take up more iron by transferrin, whereas male mutant mice take up more iron from H-ferritin at PND22. Furthermore, we begin to elucidate the mechanism for uptake using immunohistochemistry to profile the regional distribution and temporal expression of transferrin receptor and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 2, the latter is the receptor for H-ferritin. These data demonstrate that sex and genotype have significant effects on iron uptake and that regional receptor expression may play a large role in the uptake patterns during development.

31368479,Bayesian estimation of genetic regulatory effects in high-throughput reporter assays.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>High-throughput reporter assays dramatically improve our ability to assign function to noncoding genetic variants, by measuring allelic effects on gene expression in the controlled setting of a reporter gene. Unlike genetic association tests, such assays are not confounded by linkage disequilibrium when loci are independently assayed. These methods can thus improve the identification of causal disease mutations. While work continues on improving experimental aspects of these assays, less effort has gone into developing methods for assessing the statistical significance of assay results, particularly in the case of rare variants captured from patient DNA.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model, called Bayesian Inference of Regulatory Differences, which integrates prior information and explicitly accounts for variability between experimental replicates. The model produces substantially more accurate predictions than existing methods when allele frequencies are low, which is of clear advantage in the search for disease-causing variants in DNA captured from patient cohorts. Using the model, we demonstrate a clear tradeoff between variant sequencing coverage and numbers of biological replicates, and we show that the use of additional biological replicates decreases variance in estimates of effect size, due to the properties of the Poisson-binomial distribution. We also provide a power and sample size calculator, which facilitates decision making in experimental design parameters.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software is freely available from www.geneprediction.org/bird.

31400221,Alternating EM algorithm for a bilinear model in isoform quantification from RNA-seq data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Estimation of isoform-level gene expression from RNA-seq data depends on simplifying assumptions, such as uniform read distribution, that are easily violated in real data. Such violations typically lead to biased estimates. Most existing methods provide bias correction step(s), which is based on biological considerations-such as GC content-and applied in single samples separately. The main problem is that not all biases are known.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a novel method called XAEM based on a more flexible and robust statistical model. Existing methods are essentially based on a linear model X, where the design matrix X is known and is computed based on the simplifying assumptions. In contrast XAEM considers X as a bilinear model with both X and  unknown. Joint estimation of X and  is made possible by a simultaneous analysis of multi-sample RNA-seq data. Compared to existing methods, XAEM automatically performs empirical correction of potentially unknown biases. We use an alternating expectation-maximization (AEM) algorithm, alternating between estimation of X and . For speed XAEM utilizes quasi-mapping for read alignment, thus leading to a fast algorithm. Overall XAEM performs favorably compared to recent advanced methods. For simulated datasets, XAEM obtains higher accuracy for multiple-isoform genes. In a differential-expression analysis of a real single-cell RNA-seq dataset, XAEM achieves substantially better rediscovery rates in independent validation sets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The method and pipeline are implemented as a tool and freely available for use at http://fafner.meb.ki.se/biostatwiki/xaem/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

31439548,Meflin-Positive Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Inhibit Pancreatic Carcinogenesis.,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) constitute a major component of the tumor microenvironment. Recent observations in genetically engineered mouse models and clinical studies have suggested that there may exist at least two functionally different populations of CAFs, that is, cancer-promoting CAFs (pCAF) and cancer-restraining CAFs (rCAF). Although various pCAF markers have been identified, the identity of rCAFs remains unknown because of the lack of rCAF-specific marker(s). In this study, we found that Meflin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is a marker of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and maintains their undifferentiated state, is expressed by pancreatic stellate cells that are a source of CAFs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). <i>In situ</i> hybridization analysis of 71 human PDAC tissues revealed that the infiltration of Meflin-positive CAFs correlated with favorable patient outcome. Consistent herewith, Meflin deficiency led to significant tumor progression with poorly differentiated histology in a PDAC mouse model. Similarly, genetic ablation of Meflin-positive CAFs resulted in poor differentiation of tumors in a syngeneic transplantation model. Conversely, delivery of a Meflin-expressing lentivirus into the tumor stroma or overexpression of Meflin in CAFs suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors. Lineage tracing revealed that Meflin-positive cells gave rise to a-smooth muscle actin-positive CAFs that are positive or negative for Meflin, suggesting a mechanism for generating CAF heterogeneity. Meflin deficiency or low expression resulted in straightened stromal collagen fibers, which represent a signature for aggressive tumors, in mouse or human PDAC tissues, respectively. Together, the data suggest that Meflin is a marker of rCAFs that suppress PDAC progression. SIGNIFICANCE: Meflin marks and functionally contributes to a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts that exert antitumoral effects.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/20/5367/F1.large.jpg.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31448721,Renal length and volume prediction in healthy children.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Little information is available regarding the evaluation of renal volume in healthy Latin-American children of different ages. The objective of this work was to establish a predictive model of renal size (volume and length) and develop a web-based calculator.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A selective and representative sample was obtained randomly from the database of healthy children living in Resistencia city, Chaco, Argentina: a) the National Health Program for children under 6 years old; b)school children until 18 years old (primary and middle education). Renal dimensions were obtained by ultrasonography via a single experienced operator at the indicated site (schools or primary health care centers). Renal volume was calculated using Dinkel's formula. A multiple linear regression model was applied using potential predictors. The final model was implemented in a free web-based application.<h4>Results</h4>Random selection was made from the database to include 882 subjects with ages between 0.03 and 230.63 months. The data was divided into two sets (one for training and the other for model testing). The training set (423) included 212 (50%) females. Significant predictors included age, height, current weight and birth weight, and the interaction between age and present weight. Using the test dataset, both renal volume and length root mean square errors were 5.06 cm<sup>3</sup> and 0.59 cm.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prediction model was accurate and allowed for the development a freely-available web app: Renal size prediction (https://porbm28.shinyapps.io/RenalVolume/). Once the models are validated by additional studies, the app could be a useful tool to predict renal volume and length in pediatric clinical practice.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Magnesium sulfate (Mg) showed a kidney-protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) by regulating renal platinum accumulation both in vitro and in vivo, and the body of clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of this drug in adult cancer patients is increasing.In this open, multicenter, phase-2, randomized trial, patients under age 18 years who are scheduled to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy will be enrolled and randomly allocated either to an Mg supplementation arm in even-numbered chemotherapy courses (arm AB) or to another arm in odd-numbered courses (arm BA), with a 1:1 allocation. Analysis objects will be reconstructed into two groups depending on whether the chemotherapy course has Mg supplementation (group B) or not (group A). The primary endpoint is the proportion of chemotherapy courses resulting in elevated serum creatinine equal to or greater than 50% of the prechemotherapy value. For the secondary endpoints, various parameters for measuring kidney function, such as serum cystatin-C, B2M, L-FABP, NGAL, and urinary NAG in the two groups will be compared. A sample size based on alpha=5% and 80% power requires at least 40 samples per group (ideally, 60 samples per group).If Mg demonstrates efficacy, a phase-3 study to confirm the prophylactic effect of Mg supplementation in both acute and chronic CIN will be developed using novel and better biomarkers.

31573931,Development of Ovarian Tissue Autograft to Restore Ovarian Function: Protocol for a French Multicenter Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND:Sterility is a major late effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments. Iatrogenic sterility is often permanent and greatly impacts long-term quality of life. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) performed before gonadotoxic treatments with subsequent autograft is a method of fertility preservation available for girls and women. Its application in prepubertal girls is of particular value as it is the only possible approach in this patient group. In addition, it does not require a delay in cancer therapy and no ovarian stimulation is needed. OBJECTIVE:The primary aim of this protocol is to help increase the implementation of ovarian tissue autografting in France. Knowledge is still lacking regarding the efficacy of ovarian transplantation in restoring ovarian function and regarding the safety of this procedure, especially the risk of cancer cell reseeding in certain types of cancer. A secondary aim of this study is to generate data to improve our understanding of these two essential aspects. METHODS:The DATOR (Development of Ovarian Tissue Autograft in Order to Restore Ovarian Function) study is ongoing in 17 university hospitals. The DATOR protocol includes the autograft of ovarian cortex fragments. Candidates are identified from an observational prospective cohort (called the Prospective Cohort of Patients Candidates for Ovarian Tissue Autograft [PERIDATOR]) of patients who have undergone OTC. Enrollment in the study is initiated at the patient's request and must be validated by the center's multidisciplinary team and by the study steering committee. The DATOR study begins with a total medical checkup. Ovarian tissue qualification and residual disease detection, if required, are performed. RESULTS:The study is ongoing. Currently, 38 patients have provided informed consent and have been entered into the DATOR study. Graft has been performed for 34 of these patients. An interim analysis was conducted on the first 25 patients for whom the period of at least 1 year posttransplantation was achieved. Out of these 25 patients, 11 women succeeded in becoming pregnant (pregnancy rate=44% [11/25]; delivery rate=40% [10/25]). Among these, 6 women conceived twice, and 1 pregnancy led to a miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS:Our preliminary analysis appears to be coherent with the accumulating body of evidence indicating the potential utility of ovarian tissue autograft for patients with premature ovarian failure. All these elements justify the pursuit of our study. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02846064; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02846064.

31618061,Lexical-Level Predictors of Reading Comprehension in Third Grade: Is Spelling a Unique Contributor?,"Purpose Considerable research effort has focused on understanding reading comprehension and reading comprehension difficulties. The purpose of this correlational study was to add to the small but growing body of literature on the role that spelling may play in reading comprehension, by investigating the full range of lexical-level literacy skills and whether spelling makes a unique contribution. This study also explored whether these relations vary with the spelling scoring metric. Method Data were collected from 63 children attending Grade 3 in a Midwestern state. In addition to measuring reading comprehension, word recognition, and vocabulary, 4 spelling scoring metrics were examined: the number of words spelled correctly, the number of correct letter sequences (CLS), and Spelling Sensitivity Scores for elements and for words. Results All spelling metrics were significantly correlated with reading comprehension. Results of hierarchical regressions showed that spelling was a significant, unique predictor of reading comprehension when the CLS metric was used. The scoring metrics were differentially related to reading comprehension. Metrics that gave credit based on orthographic precision only (number of words spelled correctly and CLS) were more highly related to reading comprehension than metrics that scored not only on orthographic accuracy but also on phonological and morphological accuracy (Spelling Sensitivity Scores for elements and for words). Conclusion These results indicate that spelling is related to reading comprehension and have theoretical and clinical implications for the use of spelling assessment.

31633588,Widespread Pain Is Associated with Increased Risk of No Clinical Improvement After TKA in Women.,"<h4>Background</h4>When conservative treatments do not work, TKA may be the best option for patients with knee osteoarthritis, although a relatively large proportion of individuals do not have clinically important improvement after TKA. Evidence also suggests that women are less likely to benefit from TKA than men, but the reasons are unclear. Widespread pain disproportionately affects women and has been associated with worse outcomes after joint arthroplasty, yet it is unknown if the effect of widespread pain on TKA outcomes differs by patient gender.<h4>Questions/purposes</h4>(1) Does the association between widespread pain and no clinically important improvement in osteoarthritis-related pain and disability 2 years after TKA differ between men and women? (2) Does the use of pain medications 2 years after TKA differ between those with widespread pain and those without widespread pain before surgery?<h4>Methods</h4>Osteoarthritis Initiative (https://nda.nih.gov/oai/) study participants were followed annually from March 2005 until October 2015. Participants who underwent TKA up to the 7-year follow-up visit with pain/disability assessment at the protocol-planned visit before TKA and at the second planned annual visit after surgery were included in the analysis. Among 4796 study participants, 391 had a confirmed TKA, including 315 with pain/disability assessment at the protocol-planned visit before TKA. Overall, 95% of participants (298) had the required follow-up assessment; 5% (17) did not have follow-up data. Widespread pain was defined based on the modified American College of Rheumatology criteria. Symptoms were assessed using the WOMAC pain (range 0 to 20; higher score, more pain) and disability (range 0 to 68; higher score, more disability) scores, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (range 0 to 100; higher score, less pain). Improvements in pain and disability were classified based on improvement from established clinically important differences (decrease in WOMAC pain = 1.5; decrease in WOMAC disability = 6.0; increase in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain = 9). At baseline, more women presented with widespread pain than men (45% [84 of 184] versus 32% [36 of 114]). Probability and the relative risk (RR) of no clinically important improvement were estimated using a logistic regression analysis in which participants with widespread pain and those without were compared. The analyses were done for men and women separately, then adjusted for depression and baseline outcome scores.<h4>Results</h4>Among women, preoperative widespread pain was associated with an increased risk of no clinically important improvement 2 years after TKA, based on WOMAC pain scores (13.5% versus 4.6%; RR 2.93 [95% CI 1.18 to 7.30]; p = 0.02) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (16.5% versus 4.9%; RR 3.39 [95% CI 1.34 to 8.59]; p = 0.02). Given the lower and upper limits of the confidence intervals, our data are compatible with a broad range of disparate associations between widespread pain and lack of clinically important improvement in WOMAC pain scores (RR 0.77 [95% CI 0.22 to 2.70]; p = 0.68) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (RR 1.37 [95% CI 0.47 to 4.00]; p = 0.57) among men, as well as clinically important improvement in WOMAC disability scores among men (RR 0.72 [95% CI 0.20 to 2.55]; p = 0.61) and women (RR 1.98 [95% CI 0.92 to 4.26]; p = 0.08). Participants presenting with widespread pain before TKA were more likely than those without widespread pain to use medication for symptoms of knee osteoarthritis most days for at least 1 month 2 years after TKA (51% [61 of 120] versus 32% [57 of 178]; mean difference, 18.8 [95% CI 7.3 to 30.1]; p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Widespread pain before TKA was associated with an increased risk of no clinically important improvement in knee pain 2 years postoperatively among women. Because of the small number of men with widespread pain in the sample, the results for men were inconclusive. In clinical practice, screening TKA candidates for widespread pain may be useful, and expectations of surgical outcomes may need to be tempered if patients have a concurrent diagnosis of widespread pain. Future studies should include more men with widespread pain and investigate if treatment of widespread pain before or concurrent with TKA surgery may improve surgical outcomes.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Level III, therapeutic study.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
31656094,"Genetic Susceptibility, Dietary Protein Intake, and Changes of Blood Pressure: The POUNDS Lost Trial.","High blood pressure (BP) is closely related to obesity, and weight loss lowers BP. Evidence has shown considerable interpersonal variation of changes in BP among people experiencing weight loss, and such variation might be partly determined by genetic factors. We assessed the changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) among 692 participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient content for 2 years. Two separate polygenic scores (SBP/DBP-PGS derived from 52/50 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were built for each participant based on 66 BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a 2-year intervention, participants in the bottom versus upper tertile of SBP/DBP-PGS had a greater decrease in SBP (<U+25B3>SBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.84 versus -1.61, -4.76 versus -2.75, -2.49 versus -1.63; <i>P</i>=0.001) or in DBP (<U+25B3>DBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.09 versus -1.34, -2.69 versus -1.44, -1.82 versus -0.53; <i>P</i><0.001). We also found gene-diet interaction on changes in SBP from baseline to 24 months (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.009). Among participants assigned to a high-protein diet, those with a lower SBP-polygenic scores had greater decreases in SBP at months 6 (<i>P</i>=0.018), months 12 (<i>P</i>=0.007), and months 24 (<i>P</i>=0.089); while no significant difference was observed across the SBP-polygenic scores tertile groups among those assigned to an average-protein diet (all <i>P</i> values >0.05). Our data indicate that genetic susceptibility may affect BP changes in response to weight-loss diet interventions, and protein intake may modify the genetic associations with changes in BP.

31730280,Temperature dependence of NMR chemical shifts: Tracking and statistical analysis.,"Isotropic chemical shifts measured by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offer extensive insights into protein structure and dynamics. Temperature dependences add a valuable dimension; notably, the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts are valuable probes of hydrogen bonding, temperature-dependent loss of structure, and exchange between distinct protein conformations. Accordingly, their uses include structural analysis of both folded and disordered proteins, and determination of the effects of mutations, binding, or solution conditions on protein energetics. Fundamentally, these temperature dependences result from changes in the local magnetic environments of nuclei, but correlations with global thermodynamic parameters measured via calorimetric methods have been observed. Although the temperature dependences of amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts are often well approximated by a linear model, deviations from linearity are also observed and may be interpreted as evidence of fast exchange between distinct conformational states. Here, we describe computational methods, accessible via the Shift-T web server, including an automated tracking algorithm that propagates initial (single temperature) <sup>1</sup> H<U+F8FF><sup>15</sup> N cross peak assignments to spectra collected over a range of temperatures. Amide proton and nitrogen temperature coefficients (slopes determined by fitting chemical shift vs. temperature data to a linear model) are subsequently calculated. Also included are methods for the detection of systematic, statistically significant deviation from linearity (curvature) in the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts. The use and utility of these methods are illustrated by example, and the Shift-T web server is freely available at http://meieringlab.uwaterloo.ca/shiftt.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

31784425,Single-Cell Gene Expression Analyses Reveal Distinct Self-Renewing and Proliferating Subsets in the Leukemia Stem Cell Compartment in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"Standard chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) targets proliferative cells and efficiently induces complete remission; however, many patients relapse and die of their disease. Relapse is caused by leukemia stem cells (LSC), the cells with self-renewal capacity. Self-renewal and proliferation are separate functions in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in steady-state conditions. If these functions are also separate functions in LSCs, then antiproliferative therapies may fail to target self-renewal, allowing for relapse. We investigated whether proliferation and self-renewal are separate functions in LSCs as they often are in HSCs. Distinct transcriptional profiles within LSCs of Mll-AF9/NRASG12V murine AML were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing. Single-cell qPCR revealed that these genes were also differentially expressed in primary human LSCs and normal human HSPCs. A smaller subset of these genes was upregulated in LSCs relative to HSPCs; this subset of genes constitutes """"LSC-specific"""" genes in human AML. To assess the differences between these profiles, we identified cell surface markers, CD69 and CD36, whose genes were differentially expressed between these profiles. In vivo mouse reconstitution assays resealed that only CD69High LSCs were capable of self-renewal and were poorly proliferative. In contrast, CD36High LSCs were unable to transplant leukemia but were highly proliferative. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional foundations of self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in LSCs as they often are in normal stem cells and suggest that therapeutic strategies that target self-renewal, in addition to proliferation, are critical to prevent relapse and improve survival in AML. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings define and functionally validate a self-renewal gene profile of leukemia stem cells at the single-cell level and demonstrate that self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in AML.

As a new type of management model, smartphone apps are global, convenient, cheap, and interactive. Although apps were proved to be more effective at glycemic control, compared with traditional computer- and Web-based telemedicine technologies, how to gain a further and sustained improvement is still being explored. OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an app-based interactive management model by a professional health care team on glycemic control in Chinese patients with poorly controlled diabetes. METHODS:This study was a 6-month long, single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial. A total of 276 type 1 or type 2 diabetes patients were enrolled and randomized to the control group (group A), app self-management group (group B), and app interactive management group (group C) in a 1:1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. RESULTS:At months 3 and 6, all 3 groups showed significant decreases in HbA1c levels (all P<.05). Patients in the app interactive management group had a significantly lower HbA1clevel than those in the app self-management group at 6 months (P=.04). The average HbA1c reduction in the app interactive management group was larger than that in the app self-management and control groups at both months 3 and 6 (all P<.05). However, no differences in HbA1c reduction were observed between the app self-management and control groups at both months 3 and 6 (both P>.05). Multivariate line regression analyses also showed that the app interactive management group was associated with the larger reduction of HbA1c compared with groups A and B at both months 3 and 6 (all P>.05). In addition, the app interactive management group had better control of triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at both months 3 and 6 compared with baseline (both P<.05). CONCLUSIONS:In Chinese patients with poorly controlled diabetes, it was difficult to achieve long-term effective glucose improvement by using app self-management alone, but combining it with interactive management can help achieve rapid and sustained glycemic control.

Air pollution was identified as the leading health risk factor in the physical environment, followed by water pollution, soil pollution/heavy metals/chemicals and occupational exposures, however neglecting the non-chemical environmental health risk factors (e.g. mental stress and noise). Epidemiological data suggest that environmental risk factors are associated with higher risk for cardiovascular, metabolic and mental diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes, arrhythmia, stroke, depression and anxiety disorders. We provide an overview on the impact of the external exposome comprising risk factors/exposures on cardiovascular health with a focus on dysregulation of stress hormones, mitochondrial function, redox balance and inflammation with special emphasis on the circadian clock.

This can lead to patient-specific identification of the underlying mechanism of disease thereby improving diagnosis and personalizing treatment. Existing methods rely on external databases to quantify pathway activity scores. This ignores the data dependencies and that pathways are incomplete or condition-specific.<h4>Results</h4>ssNPA is a new approach for subtyping samples based on deregulation of their gene networks. ssNPA learns a causal graph directly from control data. Sample-specific network neighborhood deregulation is quantified via the error incurred in predicting the expression of each gene from its Markov blanket. We evaluate the performance of ssNPA on liver development single-cell RNA-seq data, where the correct cell timing is recovered; and two TCGA datasets, where ssNPA patient clusters have significant survival differences.

31886876,Prognostic model for multiple myeloma progression integrating gene expression and clinical features.,"BACKGROUND:Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological cancer caused by abnormal accumulation of monoclonal plasma cells in bone marrow. With the increase in treatment options, risk-adapted therapy is becoming more and more important. Survival analysis is commonly applied to study progression or other events of interest and stratify the risk of patients. RESULTS:In this study, we present the current state-of-the-art model for MM prognosis and the molecular biomarker set for stratification: the winning algorithm in the 2017 Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge, Sub-Challenge 3. Specifically, we built a non-parametric complete hazard ranking model to map the right-censored data into a linear space, where commonplace machine learning techniques, such as Gaussian process regression and random forests, can play their roles. Our model integrated both the gene expression profile and clinical features to predict the progression of MM. Compared with conventional models, such as Cox model and random survival forests, our model achieved higher accuracy in 3 within-cohort predictions. In addition, it showed robust predictive power in cross-cohort validations. Key molecular signatures related to MM progression were identified from our model, which may function as the core determinants of MM progression and provide important guidance for future research and clinical practice. Functional enrichment analysis and mammalian gene-gene interaction network revealed crucial biological processes and pathways involved in MM progression. The model is dockerized and publicly available at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11459638. Both data and reproducible code are included in the docker.

31913588,Measuring and optimising the efficiency of community hospital inpatient care for older people: the MoCHA mixed-methods study,"<h4>Background</h4>Community hospitals are small hospitals providing local inpatient and outpatient services. National surveys report that inpatient rehabilitation for older people is a core function but there are large differences in key performance measures. We have investigated these variations in community hospital ward performance.<h4>Objectives</h4>(1) To measure the relative performance of community hospital wards (studies 1 and 2); (2) to identify characteristics of community hospital wards that optimise performance (studies 1 and 3); (3) to develop a web-based interactive toolkit that supports operational changes to optimise ward performance (study 4); (4) to investigate the impact of community hospital wards on secondary care use (study 5); and (5) to investigate associations between short-term community (intermediate care) services and secondary care utilisation (study 5).<h4>Methods</h4>Study 1  we used national data to conduct econometric estimations using stochastic frontier analysis in which a cost function was modelled using significant predictors of community hospital ward costs. Study 2  a national postal survey was developed to collect data from a larger sample of community hospitals. Study 3  three ethnographic case studies were performed to provide insight into less tangible aspects of community hospital ward care. Study 4  a web-based interactive toolkit was developed by integrating the econometrics (study 1) and case study (study 3) findings. Study 5  regression analyses were conducted using data from the Atlas of Variation Map 61 (rate of emergency admissions to hospital for people aged = 75 years with a length of stay of < 24 hours) and the National Audit of Intermediate Care.<h4>Results</h4>Community hospital ward efficiency is comparable with the NHS acute hospital sector (mean cost efficiency 0.83, range 0.720.92). The rank order of community hospital ward efficiencies was distinguished to facilitate learning across the sector. On average, if all community hospital wards were operating in line with the highest cost efficiency, savings of 17% (or 47M per year) could be achieved (price year 2013/14) for our sample of 101 wards. Significant economies of scale were found: a 1% rise in output was associated with an average 0.85% increase in costs. We were unable to obtain a larger community hospital sample because of the low response rate to our national survey. The case studies identified how rehabilitation was delivered through collaborative, interdisciplinary working; interprofessional communication; and meaningful patient and family engagement. We also developed insight into patients recovery trajectories and care transitions. The web-based interactive toolkit was established [http://mocha.nhsbenchmarking.nhs.uk/ (accessed 9 September 2019)]. The crisis response team type of intermediate care, but not community hospitals, had a statistically significant negative association with emergency admissions.<h4>Limitations</h4>The econometric analyses were based on cross-sectional data and were also limited by missing data. The low response rate to our national survey means that we cannot extrapolate reliably from our community hospital sample.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results suggest that significant community hospital ward savings may be realised by improving modifiable performance factors that might be augmented further by economies of scale.<h4>Future work</h4>How less efficient hospitals might reduce costs and sustain quality requires further research.<h4>Funding</h4>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research programme and will be published in full in Health Services and Delivery Research; Vol. 8, No. 1.

31921518,A transcriptomic study of probenecid on injured spinal cords in mice.,"Background:Recent studies have found that probenecid has neuroprotective and reparative effects on central nervous system injuries. However, its effect on genome-wide transcription in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) remains unknown. In the present study, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is used to analyze the effect of probenecid on the local expression of gene transcription 8 h after spinal injury. Methods:An Infinite Horizon impactor was used to perform contusive SCI in mice. The SCI model was made by using a rod (1.3 mm diameter) with a force of 50 Kdynes. Sham-operated mice only received a laminectomy without contusive injury. The injured mice were randomly assigned into either the control (SCI_C) or probenecid injection (SCI_P) group. In the latter group, the probenecid drug was intraperitoneally injected (0.5 mg/kg) immediately following injury. Eight hours after the injury or laminectomy, the spinal cords were removed from the mice in both groups. The total RNAs were extracted and purified for library preparation and transcriptome sequencing. Differential gene expressions (DEGs) of the three groups-sham, SCI_C and SCI_P-were analyzed using a DESeq software. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed using a GOseq R package and KOBAS software. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to validate RNA-Seq results. Results:RNA-Seq showed that, compared to the SCI_C group, the number of DEGs was 641 in the SCI_P group (286 upregulated and 355 downregulated). According to GO analysis, DEGs were most enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen trimer, protein bounding and sequence specific DNA binding. KEGG analysis showed that the most enriched pathways included: cell adhesion molecules, Leukocyte transendothelial migration, ECM-receptor interactions, PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, hematopoietic cell lineages, focal adhesions, the Rap1 signaling pathway, etc. The sequence data have been deposited into the Sequence Read Archive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA554464).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data deposited as referenced
32022843,FTIP: an accurate and efficient method for global protein surface comparison.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Global protein surface comparison (GPSC) studies have been limited compared to other research works on protein structure alignment/comparison due to lack of real applications associated with GPSC. However, the technology advances in cryo-electron tomography (CET) have made methods to identify proteins from their surface shapes extremely useful.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we developed a new method called Farthest point sampling (FPS)-enhanced Triangulation-based Iterative-closest-Point (ICP) (FTIP) for GPSC. We applied it to protein classification using only surface shape information. Our method first extracts a set of feature points from protein surfaces using FPS and then uses a triangulation-based efficient ICP algorithm to align the feature points of the two proteins to be compared. Tested on a benchmark dataset with 2329 proteins using nearest-neighbor classification, FTIP outperformed the state-of-the-art method for GPSC based on 3D Zernike descriptors. Using real and simulated cryo-EM data, we show that FTIP could be applied in the future to address problems in protein identification in CET experiments.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Programs/scripts we developed/used in the study are available at http://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~yuan/index.fld/FTIP.tar.bz2.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32025087,Reassessing Southern Ocean Air-Sea CO2 Flux Estimates With the Addition of Biogeochemical Float Observations.,"New estimates of pCO2 from profiling floats deployed by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project have demonstrated the importance of wintertime outgassing south of the Polar Front, challenging the accepted magnitude of Southern Ocean carbon uptake (Gray et al., 2018, https://doi:10.1029/2018GL078013). Here, we put 3.5 years of SOCCOM observations into broader context with the global surface carbon dioxide database (Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas, SOCAT) by using the two interpolation methods currently used to assess the ocean models in the Global Carbon Budget (Le Qur et al., 2018, https://doi:10.5194/essd-10-2141-2018) to create a ship-only, a float-weighted, and a combined estimate of Southern Ocean carbon fluxes (<35S). In our ship-only estimate, we calculate a mean uptake of -1.14  0.19 Pg C/yr for 2015-2017, consistent with prior studies. The float-weighted estimate yields a significantly lower Southern Ocean uptake of -0.35  0.19 Pg C/yr. Subsampling of high-resolution ocean biogeochemical process models indicates that some of the differences between float and ship-only estimates of the Southern Ocean carbon flux can be explained by spatial and temporal sampling differences. The combined ship and float estimate minimizes the root-mean-square pCO2 difference between the mapped product and both data sets, giving a new Southern Ocean uptake of -0.75  0.22 Pg C/yr, though with uncertainties that overlap the ship-only estimate. An atmospheric inversion reveals that a shift of this magnitude in the contemporary Southern Ocean carbon flux must be compensated for by ocean or land sinks within the Southern Hemisphere.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32043185,Metabolic alterations in immune cells associate with progression to type 1 diabetes.,"<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>Previous metabolomics studies suggest that type 1 diabetes is preceded by specific metabolic disturbances. The aim of this study was to investigate whether distinct metabolic patterns occur in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of children who later develop pancreatic beta cell autoimmunity or overt type 1 diabetes.<h4>Methods</h4>In a longitudinal cohort setting, PBMC metabolomic analysis was applied in children who (1) progressed to type 1 diabetes (PT1D, n = 34), (2) seroconverted to =1 islet autoantibody without progressing to type 1 diabetes (P1Ab, n = 27) or (3) remained autoantibody negative during follow-up (CTRL, n = 10).<h4>Results</h4>During the first year of life, levels of most lipids and polar metabolites were lower in the PT1D and P1Ab groups compared with the CTRL group. Pathway over-representation analysis suggested alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism were over-represented in PT1D. Genome-scale metabolic models of PBMCs during type 1 diabetes progression were developed by using publicly available transcriptomics data and constrained with metabolomics data from our study. Metabolic modelling confirmed altered ceramide pathways, known to play an important role in immune regulation, as specifically associated with type 1 diabetes progression.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our data suggest that systemic dysregulation of lipid metabolism, as observed in plasma, may impact the metabolism and function of immune cells during progression to overt type 1 diabetes.<h4>Data availability</h4>The GEMs for PBMCs have been submitted to BioModels (www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), under accession number MODEL1905270001. The metabolomics datasets and the clinical metadata generated in this study were submitted to MetaboLights (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/), under accession number MTBLS1015.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data deposited as referenced
32078592,"Characteristics and Health Status of Informal Unpaid Caregivers - 44 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 2015-2017.","In 2015, an estimated 17.7 million U.S. persons were informal caregivers who provided substantial services through in-home, unpaid assistance to their family members and friends (1). Caregiving can have many benefits, such as enhancing the bond between caregiver and recipient, but it can also place an emotional and physical strain on caregivers, leading to higher rates of depression, lower quality of life, and poorer overall health (2). As the U.S. population continues to age (3), the need for informal caregivers will likely increase. However, little nationally representative information on prevalence of caregivers is available. This study examined demographic characteristics and health status of informal caregivers from 44 states,* the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico, based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collected during 2015-2017. Overall, approximately one in five adults reported that they had provided care to a family member or friend in the preceding 30 days. Fifty-eight percent of caregivers were women, and a majority were non-Hispanic white, with at least some college education, and married or living with a partner. Across all states, 19.2% of caregivers reported being in fair or poor health, although significant state-to-state variation occurred. Caregivers provide important support to family members, friends, and the health care system and might compromise their own health to provide this support (1,2). Better understanding of caregivers and the challenges they face could inform implementation of improvements in support systems that could enhance not only the health of the caregiver, but that of the care recipient as well. For example, additional data regarding demographics at the state level might aid in more effective planning and support of caregivers with evidence-based programs and assistance (https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/caring-for-yourself.html).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,public health
32110491,DISNET: a framework for extracting phenotypic disease information from public sources.,"Background:Within the global endeavour of improving population health, one major challenge is the identification and integration of medical knowledge spread through several information sources. The creation of a comprehensive dataset of diseases and their clinical manifestations based on information from public sources is an interesting approach that allows one not only to complement and merge medical knowledge but also to increase it and thereby to interconnect existing data and analyse and relate diseases to each other. In this paper, we present DISNET (http://disnet.ctb.upm.es/), a web-based system designed to periodically extract the knowledge from signs and symptoms retrieved from medical databases, and to enable the creation of customisable disease networks. Methods:We here present the main features of the DISNET system. We describe how information on diseases and their phenotypic manifestations is extracted from Wikipedia and PubMed websites; specifically, texts from these sources are processed through a combination of text mining and natural language processing techniques. Results:We further present the validation of our system on Wikipedia and PubMed texts, obtaining the relevant accuracy. The final output includes the creation of a comprehensive symptoms-disease dataset, shared (free access) through the system's API. We finally describe, with some simple use cases, how a user can interact with it and extract information that could be used for subsequent analyses. Discussion:DISNET allows retrieving knowledge about the signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests associated with a disease. It is not limited to a specific category (all the categories that the selected sources of information offer us) and clinical diagnosis terms. It further allows to track the evolution of those terms through time, being thus an opportunity to analyse and observe the progress of human knowledge on diseases. We further discussed the validation of the system, suggesting that it is good enough to be used to extract diseases and diagnostically-relevant terms. At the same time, the evaluation also revealed that improvements could be introduced to enhance the system's reliability.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,"good, but too clinical I think"

32130122,Feasibility of an Electronic Health Tool to Promote Physical Activity in Primary Care: Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Physical inactivity is associated with increased health risks. Primary care providers (PCPs) are well positioned to support increased physical activity (PA) levels through screening and provision of PA prescriptions. However, PCP counseling on PA is not common. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing an electronic health (eHealth) tool to support PA counseling by PCPs and estimate intervention effectiveness on patients' PA levels. METHODS:A pragmatic pilot study was conducted using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design. The study was conducted at a single primary care clinic, with 4 pre-existing PCP teams. Adult patients who had a periodic health review (PHR) scheduled during the study period were invited to participate. The eHealth tool involved an electronic survey sent to participants before their PHR via an email or a tablet; data were used to automatically produce tailored resources and a PA prescription in the electronic medical record of participants in the intervention arm. Participants assigned to the control arm received usual care from their PCP. Feasibility was assessed by the proportion of completed surveys and patient-reported acceptability and fidelity measures. The primary effectiveness outcome was patient-reported PA at 4 months post-PHR, measured as metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week. Secondary outcomes assessed determinants of PA, including self-efficacy and intention to change based on the Health Action Process Approach behavior change theory. RESULTS:A total of 1028 patients receiving care from 34 PCPs were invited to participate and 530 (51.55%) consented (intervention [n=296] and control [n=234]). Of the participants who completed a process evaluation, almost half (88/178, 49.4%) stated they received a PA prescription, with only 42 receiving the full intervention including tailored resources from their PCP. A cluster-level linear regression analysis yielded a non-statistically significant positive difference in MET-minutes reported per week at follow-up between intervention and control conditions (mean difference 1027; 95% CI -155 to 2209; P=.09). No statistically significant differences were observed for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that it is feasible to build an eHealth tool that screens and provides tailored resources for PA in a primary care setting but suboptimal intervention fidelity suggests greater work must be done to address PCP barriers to resource distribution. Participant responses to the primary effectiveness outcome (MET-minutes) were highly variable, reflecting a need for more robust measures of PA in future trials to address limitations in patient-reported data.

32130186,A 21-Day School-Based Toothbrushing Intervention in Children Aged 6 to 9 Years in Indonesia and Nigeria: Protocol for a Two-Arm Superiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:The World Health Organization reports that dental cavities affect 60% to 90% of children globally. FDI World Dental Federation and Unilever Oral Care have developed public health programs to improve brushing habits over their 12-year partnership. The last of these (phase III) named Brush Day & Night aimed to educate children on brushing twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste and gave useful information for a new project, phase IV. The 21-day Brush Day & Night program is an intense education activity designed to establish the habit of brushing day and night with a fluoride toothpaste. The program involves daily brushing instruction and includes free toothpaste and toothbrushes. OBJECTIVE:The main objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a 21-day school program on children's oral health. As a secondary objective, we aim to evaluate the impact on the knowledge, behavior, toothbrushing habits, and quality of life in school children aged 6 to 9 years after a 21-day school program and compare with baseline and a control group as measured by the self-reported questionnaires issued to children (in particular, the self-reported brushing frequency and positive responses on fluoridated toothpaste use). The enduring nature of the program will be determined by the inclusion of 8- and 24-week time points. METHODS:The study is a 2-arm superiority randomized controlled trial. Clusters in this study are infant and junior schools in Indonesia and Nigeria. The study aims to recruit 20 schools with children aged 6 to 9 years in each country. At baseline, children in both intervention and control schools will answer a questionnaire and have their clinical oral health assessed using the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI) and Decayed Missing and Filled Teeth index. Children in the intervention schools will then take part in a structured 21-day Brush Day & Night intervention. Children in the control schools will be provided with free toothpaste and toothbrushes but will not receive the 21-day intervention. The questionnaires and OHI assessments are repeated after the 21-day program is completed and again 8 weeks later and 24 weeks later for all participating children. Parents/carers/guardians of all children will sign the informed consent and complete questionnaires on their own experience and attitudes toward oral health and toothbrushing routine at each of the four times points (baseline, 21 days, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks). The study will be conducted by the national dental associations of Indonesia and Nigeria and was approved by the ethics committees of both countries. RESULTS:The study is ongoing. Recruitment of schools started in Indonesia in February 2018 and in Nigeria in April 2018 for the first part of the study, which concluded in Indonesia in September 2018 and in Nigeria in November 2018. The second part of the study (the second half of the schools) started in November 2018 in Indonesia and December 2018 in Nigeria.

32139710,"Classification models for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Progression, based on gene expression data-trained supervised machine learning.","Early detection of breast cancer and its correct stage determination are important for prognosis and rendering appropriate personalized clinical treatment to breast cancer patients. However, despite considerable efforts and progress, there is a need to identify the specific genomic factors responsible for, or accompanying Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) progression stages, which can aid the determination of the correct cancer stages. We have developed two-class machine-learning classification models to differentiate the early and late stages of IDC. The prediction models are trained with RNA-seq gene expression profiles representing different IDC stages of 610 patients, obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Different supervised learning algorithms were trained and evaluated with an enriched model learning, facilitated by different feature selection methods. We also developed a machine-learning classifier trained on the same datasets with training sets reduced data corresponding to IDC driver genes. Based on these two classifiers, we have developed a web-server Duct-BRCA-CSP to predict early stage from late stages of IDC based on input RNA-seq gene expression profiles. The analysis conducted by us also enables deeper insights into the stage-dependent molecular events accompanying IDC progression.

Useful and intuitive visualization tools may help advance biomolecular and medical research; unintuitive tools may bar important breakthroughs. This protocol describes two use cases for the CellMap (http://cellmap.protein.properties) web tool. The tool allows researchers to visualize human protein-protein interaction data constrained by protein subcellular localizations. In the simplest form, proteins are visualized on cell images that also show protein-protein interactions (PPIs) through lines (edges) connecting the proteins across the compartments. At a glance, this simultaneously highlights spatial constraints that proteins are subject to in their physical environment and visualizes PPIs against these localizations. Visualizing two realities helps in decluttering the protein interaction visualization from """"hairball"""" phenomena that arise when single proteins or groups thereof interact with hundreds of partners.  2019 The Authors.

These new descriptors allow differentiating between structural prototypes, which is not possible using the commonly used chemical-only descriptors. Specifically, we demonstrate that the combination of pairwise radial, nearest neighbor, bond-angle, dihedral-angle and core-charge distributions plays an important role in predicting formation energies, bandgaps, static refractive indices, magnetic properties, and modulus of elasticity for three-dimensional (3D) materials as well as exfoliation energies of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. The training data consists of 24549 bulk and 616 monolayer materials taken from JARVIS-DFT database. We obtained very accurate ML models using gradient boosting algorithm. Then we use the trained models to discover exfoliable 2D-layered materials satisfying specific property requirements. Additionally, we integrate our formation energy ML model with a genetic algorithm for structure search to verify if the ML model reproduces the DFT convex hull. This verification establishes a more stringent evaluation metric for the ML model than what commonly used in data sciences.

32175316,RF-PseU: A Random Forest Predictor for RNA Pseudouridine Sites.,"One of the ubiquitous chemical modifications in RNA, pseudouridine modification is crucial for various cellular biological and physiological processes. To gain more insight into the functional mechanisms involved, it is of fundamental importance to precisely identify pseudouridine sites in RNA. Several useful machine learning approaches have become available recently, with the increasing progress of next-generation sequencing technology; however, existing methods cannot predict sites with high accuracy. Thus, a more accurate predictor is required. In this study, a random forest-based predictor named RF-PseU is proposed for prediction of pseudouridylation sites. To optimize feature representation and obtain a better model, the light gradient boosting machine algorithm and incremental feature selection strategy were used to select the optimum feature space vector for training the random forest model RF-PseU. Compared with previous state-of-the-art predictors, the results on the same benchmark data sets of three species demonstrate that RF-PseU performs better overall. The integrated average leave-one-out cross-validation and independent testing accuracy scores were 71.4% and 74.7%, respectively, representing increments of 3.63% and 4.77% versus the best existing predictor. Moreover, the final RF-PseU model for prediction was built on leave-one-out cross-validation and provides a reliable and robust tool for identifying pseudouridine sites.

32186404,"Uterine Patterning, Endometrial Gland Development, and Implantation Failure in Mice Exposed Neonatally to Genistein.","BACKGROUND:Embryo implantation relies on precise hormonal regulation, associated gene expression changes, and appropriate female reproductive tract tissue architecture. Female mice exposed neonatally to the phytoestrogen genistein (GEN) at doses similar to those in infants consuming soy-based infant formulas are infertile due in part to uterine implantation defects. OBJECTIVES:Our goal was to determine the mechanisms by which neonatal GEN exposure causes implantation defects. METHODS:Female mice were exposed to GEN on postnatal days (PND)1-5 and uterine tissues collected on PND5, PND22-26, and during pregnancy. Analysis of tissue weights, morphology, and gene expression was performed using standard histology, confocal imaging with three-dimensional analysis, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), and microarrays. The response of ovariectomized adults to 17-estradiol (E2) and artificial decidualization were measured. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) injections were given intraperitoneally and implantation sites visualized. Gene expression patterns were compared with curated data sets to identify upstream regulators. RESULTS:GEN-exposed mice exhibited reduced uterine weight gain in response to E2 treatment or artificial decidualization compared with controls; however, expression of select hormone responsive genes remained similar between the two groups. Uteri from pregnant GEN-exposed mice were posteriorized and had reduced glandular epithelium. Implantation failure was not rescued by LIF administration. Microarray analysis of GEN-exposed uteri during early pregnancy revealed significant overlap with several conditional uterine knockout mouse models, including Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17. These models exhibit reduced endometrial glands, features of posteriorization and implantation failure. Expression of Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17, as well as genes important for neonatal uterine differentiation (Wnt7a, Hoxa10, and Msx2), were severely disrupted on PND5 in GEN-exposed mice. DISCUSSION:Our findings suggest that neonatal GEN exposure in mice disrupts expression of genes important for uterine development, causing posteriorization and diminished gland function during pregnancy that contribute to implantation failure. These findings could have implications for women who consumed soy-based formulas as infants. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6336.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32214380,Stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for visualization and estimation of transcriptional kinetics.,"Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescent imaging have enabled quantitative measurements of transcription at a single gene copy, yet an accurate understanding of transcriptional kinetics is still lacking due to the difficulty of solving detailed biophysical models. Here we introduce a stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for modeling detailed transcriptional kinetics in prokaryotic systems, which has not been solved analytically. The model includes stochastic two-state gene activation, mRNA synthesis initiation and stepwise elongation, release to the cytoplasm, and stepwise co-transcriptional degradation. Using the Gillespie algorithm, the platform simulates nascent and mature mRNA kinetics of a single gene copy and predicts fluorescent signals measurable by time-lapse single-cell mRNA imaging, for different experimental conditions. To approach the inverse problem of estimating the kinetic parameters of the model from experimental data, we develop a heuristic optimization method based on the genetic algorithm and the empirical distribution of mRNA generated by simulation. As a demonstration, we show that the optimization algorithm can successfully recover the transcriptional kinetics of simulated and experimental gene expression data.

32266474,Conjunctive reward-place coding properties of dorsal distal CA1 hippocampus cells.,"Autonomous motivated spatial navigation in animals or robots requires the association between spatial location and value. Hippocampal place cells are involved in goal-directed spatial navigation and the consolidation of spatial memories. Recently, Gauthier and Tank (Neuron 99(1):179-193, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.008) have identified a subpopulation of hippocampal cells selectively activated in relation to rewarded goals. However, the relationship between these cells' spiking activity and goal representation remains elusive. We analyzed data from experiments in which rats underwent five consecutive tasks in which reward locations and spatial context were manipulated. We found CA1 populations with properties continuously ranging from place cells to reward cells. Specifically, we found typical place cells insensitive to reward locations, reward cells that only fired at correct rewarded feeders in each task regardless of context, and """"hybrid cells"""" that responded to spatial locations and change of reward locations. Reward cells responded mostly to the reward delivery rather than to its expectation. In addition, we found a small group of neurons that transitioned between place and reward cells properties within the 5-task session. We conclude that some pyramidal cells (if not all) integrate both spatial and reward inputs to various degrees. These results provide insights into the integrative coding properties of CA1 pyramidal cells, focusing on their abilities to carry both spatial and reward information in a mixed and plastic manner. This conjunctive coding property prompts a re-thinking of current computational models of spatial navigation in which hippocampal spatial and subcortical value representations are independent.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The majority of traditional face-to-face interventions have not been effective in postpartum women. Mobile technology enables the active engagement of postpartum women to promote lifestyle changes to prevent chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE:We sought to employ an interactive, user-centered, and participatory method of development, evaluation, and iteration to design and optimize the mobile health (mHealth) Fit After Baby program. METHODS:For the initial development, a multidisciplinary team integrated evidence-based approaches for health behavior, diet and physical activity, and user-centered design and engagement. We implemented an iterative feedback and design process via 3 month-long beta pilots in which postpartum women with cardiometabolic risk factors participated in the program and provided weekly and ongoing feedback. We also conducted two group interviews using a structured interview guide to gather additional feedback. Qualitative data were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using established qualitative methods. Modifications based on feedback were integrated into successive versions of the app. RESULTS:We conducted three pilot testing rounds with a total of 26 women. Feedback from each pilot cohort informed changes to the functionality and content of the app, and then a subsequent pilot group participated in the program. We optimized the program in response to feedback through three iterations leading to a final version. CONCLUSIONS:This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an interactive, user-centered, participatory method of rapid, iterative design and evaluation to develop and optimize a mHealth intervention program for postpartum women.

32281541,Effects of the ACT OUT! Social Issue Theater Program on Social-Emotional Competence and Bullying in Youth and Adolescents: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Students in the United States spend a meaningful portion of their developmental lives in school. In recent years, researchers and educators have begun to focus explicitly on social and emotional learning (SEL) in the school setting. Initial evidence from meta-analyses suggests that curricula designed to promote SEL likely produce benefits in terms of social-emotional competence (SEC) and numerous related behavioral and affective outcomes. At the same time, there are often barriers to implementing such curricula as intended, and some researchers have questioned the strength of the evaluation data from SEL programs. As part of the effort to improve programming in SEL, this paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomized trial of the ACT OUT! Social Issue Theater program, a brief psychodramatic intervention to build SEC and reduce bullying behavior in students. OBJECTIVE:The objective of this trial is to examine if a short dose of interactive psychodrama can affect SEC metrics and bullying experiences in schoolchildren in either the short (2-week) or medium (6-month) term. METHODS:The ACT OUT! trial is a cluster randomized superiority trial with 2 parallel groups. The unit of measurement is the student, and the unit of randomization is the classroom. For each grade (fourth, seventh, and 10th), an even number of classrooms will be selected from each school-half will be assigned to the intervention arm and half will be assigned to the control arm. The intervention will consist of 3 moderated psychodramatic performances by trained actors, and the control condition will be the usual school day. Outcome data will be collected at baseline (preintervention), 2-week postintervention (short term), and 6-month postintervention (medium term). Outcomes will include social-emotional competency; self-reported bullying and experiences of being bullied; receptivity to the program; and school-level data on truancy, absenteeism, and referrals to school displinary action for bullying. A power analysis adjusted for clustering effect, design effect, and potential attrition yielded a need for approximately 1594 students, consisting of an estimated 80 classrooms split evenly into intervention and control arms. RESULTS:This study was funded in June 2019; approved by the Indiana University Institutional review board on September 17, 2019; began subject recruitment on November 5, 2019; and prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.

32293391,Evaluation of a computer-assisted multi-professional intervention to address lifestyle-related risk factors for overweight and obesity in expecting mothers and their infants: protocol for an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study.,"BACKGROUND:The first 1000 days after conception are a critical period to encourage lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of childhood obesity and early programming of chronic diseases. A healthy lifestyle during pregnancy is also crucial to avoid high post-partum weight retention. Currently, lifestyle changes are not consistently discussed during routine health services in Germany. The objective of this study is to evaluate a novel computer-assisted lifestyle intervention embedded in prenatal visits and infant check-ups. The intervention seeks to reduce lifestyle-related risk factors for overweight and obesity among expecting mothers and their infants. METHODS:The study is designed as a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to simultaneously collect data on the effectiveness and implementation of the lifestyle intervention. The trial will take place in eight regions of the German state Baden-Wuerttemberg. Region were matched using propensity score matching. Expecting mothers (n = 1860) will be recruited before 12 weeks of gestation through gynecological practices and followed for 18 months. During 11 routine prenatal visits and infant check-ups gynecologists, midwives and pediatricians provide lifestyle counseling using Motivational Interviewing techniques. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of expecting mothers with gestational weight gain within the recommended range. To understand the process of implementation (focus group) interviews will be conducted with providers and participants of the lifestyle intervention. Additionally, an analysis of administrative data and documents will be carried out. An economic analysis will provide insights into cost and consequences compared to routine health services. DISCUSSION:Findings of this study will add to the evidence on lifestyle interventions to reduce risk for overweight and obesity commenced during pregnancy. Insights gained will contribute to the prevention of early programming of chronic disease. Study results regarding implementation fidelity, adoption, reach and cost-effectiveness of the lifestyle intervention will inform decisions about scale up and public funding.

32297095,Using Complier Average Causal Effect Estimation to Examine Student Outcomes of the PAX Good Behavior Game When Integrated with the PATHS Curriculum.,"A growing body of research has documented a link between variation in implementation dosage and outcomes associated with preventive interventions. Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE; Jo in J Educ Behav Stat 27:385-409, 2002) analysis allows for estimating program impacts in light of variation in implementation. This study reports intent-to-treat (ITT) and CACE findings from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the impacts of the universal PAX Good Behavior Game (PAX GBG)integrated with Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (i.e., PATHS to PAX) and PAX GBG only compared to a control. This study used ratings by 318K-5 teachers of 1526 at-risk children who, at baseline, were rated as displaying the top 33rd percentile of aggressive-disruptive behavior. Leveraging a prior study on these data (Berg et al. in Admin Policy Ment Health Ment Health Serv Res 44:558-571, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-016-0738-1 , 2017), CACE was defined as the effect of intervention assignment for compliers, using two compliance cut points (50th and 75th percentile), on posttest ratings of student academic engagement, social competence, peer relations, emotion regulation, hyperactivity, and aggressive-disruptive behavior. The ITT analyses indicated improvements for students in the integrated condition on ratings of social competence compared to the control condition. The CACE analyses also indicated significant effects of the integrated intervention on social competence, as well as academic engagement and emotion regulation for students in high compliance classrooms. These findings illustrate the importance of considering variation in implementation within the context of RCTs.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

32382359,Multiple Relapses of Visceral Leishmaniasis in HIV Co-Infected Patients: A Case Series from Ethiopia.,"Background:Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a life-threatening protozoan disease caused by parasites belonging to the Leishmania donovani complex. Ethiopia has the highest VL-HIV co-infection rate in the world, with several of these patients presenting with repeated episodes of VL disease (ie, relapse). However, we lack data on how HIV patients with multiple VL relapse present clinically, and whether they continue to respond to currently available medicines. Methods:The medical records of VL-HIV co-infected patients with multiple VL relapses at the Leishmaniasis Treatment and Research Center in Gondar, Ethiopia, between June 2012 and June 2016 were retrieved. Variables on their clinical and laboratory profiles were collected. Descriptive analysis was done to show the characteristics of the VL episodes. Result:A total of 48 VL episodes in 12 patients were identified, the median number of episodes per patient was 5 (interquartile range, 4-8 episodes). The median time to relapse was 5 months (interquartile range, 3-5.5 months). Splenomegaly was present in 47 of the episodes (98%), fever or other accompanying symptoms were present in only 66% (32 out of 48). The median tissue parasite grade at VL diagnosis was 6+ (interquartile range, 5+- 6+). All patients were on antiretroviral therapy. The median duration of treatment per episode was 2 months (interquartile range, 2-2 months). All patients achieved parasitological cure at discharge at each episode. Conclusions:Multiple recurrences of VL diseases were observed in HIV co-infected patients. With recurrent episodes, splenomegaly was found to be the main manifestation, whereas fever was less common. These patients came with recurrence of diseases in <6 months and required prolonged treatment to achieve cure.Further research on prediction, prevention, and better management options for recurrent VL is needed.

32391909,Global ocean resistome revealed: Exploring antibiotic resistance gene abundance and distribution in TARA Oceans samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>The rise of antibiotic resistance (AR) in clinical settings is of great concern. Therefore, the understanding of AR mechanisms, evolution, and global distribution is a priority for patient survival. Despite all efforts in the elucidation of AR mechanisms in clinical strains, little is known about its prevalence and evolution in environmental microorganisms. We used 293 metagenomic samples from the TARA Oceans project to detect and quantify environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using machine learning tools.<h4>Results</h4>After manual curation of ARGs, their abundance and distribution in the global ocean are presented. Additionally, the potential of horizontal ARG transfer by plasmids and their correlation with environmental and geographical parameters is shown. A total of 99,205 environmental open reading frames (ORFs) were classified as 1 of 560 different ARGs conferring resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. We found 24,567 ORFs in putative plasmid sequences, suggesting the importance of mobile genetic elements in the dynamics of environmental ARG transmission. Moreover, 4,804 contigs with >=2 putative ARGs were found, including 2 plasmid-like contigs with 5 different ARGs, highlighting the potential presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in the natural ocean environment. Finally, we identified ARGs conferring resistance to some of the most relevant clinical antibiotics, revealing the presence of 15 ARGs similar to mobilized colistin resistance genes (mcr) with high abundance on polar biomes. Of these, 5 are assigned to Psychrobacter, a genus including opportunistic human pathogens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study uncovers the diversity and abundance of ARGs in the global ocean metagenome. Our results are available on Zenodo in MySQL database dump format, and all the code used for the analyses, including a Jupyter notebook js avaliable on Github. We also developed a dashboard web application (http://www.resistomedb.com) for data visualization.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data deposited as referenced

32419835,Integrated Analysis of the Mechanisms of Da-Chai-Hu Decoction in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by a Network Pharmacology Approach.,"Background:The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased year by year, which not only seriously affects people's quality of life, but also imposes a heavy economic burden on the family, society, and country. Currently, the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of T2DM are still unclear. Therefore, exploration of a precise multitarget treatment strategy is urgent. Here, we attempt to screen out the active components, effective targets, and functional pathways of therapeutic drugs through network pharmacology with taking advantages of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas for multitarget holistic treatment of diseases to clarify the potential therapeutic mechanism of TCM formulas and provide a systematic and clear thought for T2DM treatment. Methods:First, we screened the active components of Da-Chai-Hu Decoction (DCHD) by absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T) calculation. Second, we predicted and screened the active components of DCHD and its therapeutic targets for T2DM relying on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Analysis Platform (TCMSP database) and Text Mining Tool (GoPubMed database), while using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to obtain T2DM targets. Third, we constructed a network of the active component-target, target-pathway of DCHD using Cytoscape software (http://cytoscape.org/,ver.3.5.1) and then analyzed gene function, related biological processes, and signal pathways through the DAVID database. Results:We screened 77 active components from 1278 DCHD components and 116 effective targets from 253 ones. After matching the targets of T2DM, we obtained 38 important targets and 7 core targets were selected through further analysis. Through enrichment analysis, we found that these important targets were mainly involved in many biological processes such as oxidative stress, inflammatory reaction, and apoptosis. After analyzing the relevant pathways, the synthetic pathway for the treatment of T2DM was obtained, which provided a diagnosis-treatment idea for DCHD in the treatment of T2DM. Conclusions:This article reveals the mechanism of DCHD in the treatment of T2DM related to inflammatory response and apoptosis through network pharmacology, which lays a foundation for further elucidation of drugs effective targets.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32438827,Long-Term Exposure to Air Pollution and Incidence of Myocardial Infarction: A Danish Nurse Cohort Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Air pollution exposure has been linked to coronary heart disease, although evidence on PM2.5 and myocardial infarction (MI) incidence is mixed.<h4>Objectives</h4>This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate associations between long-term exposure to air pollution and MI incidence, adjusting for road traffic noise.<h4>Methods</h4>We used data from the nationwide Danish Nurse Cohort on 22,882 female nurses (>44 years of age) who, at recruitment in 1993 or 1999, reported information on cardiovascular disease risk factors. Data on MI incidence was collected from the Danish National Patient Register until the end of 2014. Annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with a diameter <2.5 g/m3 (PM2.5), PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the nurses' residences since 1990 (PM10 and PM2.5) or 1970 (NO2 and NOx) were estimated using the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model/Urban Background Model/AirGIS (DEHM/UBM/AirGIS) dispersion model. We used time-varying Cox regression models to examine the association between 1- and 3-y running means of these pollutants, as well as 23-y running means of NO2 and NOx, with both overall and fatal incident MI. Associations were explored in three progressively adjusted models: Model 1, adjusted for age and baseline year; Model 2, with further adjustment for potential confounding by lifestyle and cardiovascular disease risk factors; and Model 3, with further adjustment for road traffic noise, modeled as the annual mean of a weighted 24-h average (Lden).<h4>Results</h4>Of the 22,882 women, 641 developed MI during a mean follow-up of 18.6 y, 121 (18.9%) of which were fatal. Reported hazard ratios (HRs) were based on interquartile range increases of 5.3, 5.5, 8.1, and 11.5 g/m3 for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx, respectively. In Model 1, we observed a positive association between a 3-y running mean of PM2.5 and an overall incident MI with an HR= 1.20 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.35), which attenuated to HR= 1.06 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.23) in Model 2. In Model 1 for incident fatal MI, we observed a strong association with a 3-y running mean of PM2.5, with an HR= 1.69 (95% CI: 1.33, 2.13), which attenuated to HR= 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.81) in Model 2. Similar associations were seen for PM10, with 3-y, Model 2 estimates for overall and fatal incident MI of HR= 1.06 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.23) and HR= 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.81), respectively. No evidence of an association was observed for NO2 or NOx. For all pollutants, associations in Model 2 were robust to further adjustment for road traffic noise in Model 3 and were similar for a 1-y running mean exposure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We found no association between long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, or NOx and overall MI incidence, but we observed positive associations for PM2.5 and PM10 with fatal MI. We present novel findings that the association between PM and MI incidence is robust to adjustment for road traffic noise. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5818.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32440109,Proteome Profiling of Lung Tissues in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Platelet and Macrophage Dysfunction Contribute to the Pathogenesis of COPD.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide public health challenge due to its high prevalence and related disability and mortality; however, the pathogenesis of COPD remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify key proteins involved in the pathogenesis of COPD.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We collected lung tissue from three patients with COPD who required thoracic surgery for lung transplantation in the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Lung tissue from three donors who had no history of lung disease <U+FEFF>was collected as healthy controls through a whole-body donation program of Peking Union Medical College (China). We conducted a proteomic analysis of the protein expression profiles in the two groups using a combination of high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantitative 6-plex tandem mass tag-labeling; these data were validated by Western blot analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 4976 proteins were identi<U+FB01>ed and analyzed, of which 173 were significantly changed (118 downregulated and 55 upregulated). Gene ontology analysis and protein-protein interaction networks demonstrated that the significantly changed proteins, especially downregulated proteins, were involved in platelet and macrophage activation. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the iProX partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD017158.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In our study, GP6, PF4, and THBS1, which are associated with platelet activation and wound healing, were significantly downregulated in COPD patients. These results indicate that patients with COPD are more likely to develop hemostasis disorders, which could impede the repair process of the lung tissues. Moreover, downregulation of CD163, MARCO and VSIG4, which are involved in dysfunction of alveolar macrophages in efferocytosis, may inhibit the resolution of inflammation and contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data deposited as referenced

We investigated the genetic causes of MWS in a 14-year-old girl who had characteristic features of MWS.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical data and peripheral blood DNA samples were collected from the proband. Following extraction of genomic DNA, whole-exome sequencing was conducted to detect genetic variants. Bioinformaticsanalysis wascarriedoutto predictthefunction of the mutant gene.<h4>Results</h4>Mutation analysis of the proband identified a novel nonsense mutation (c.250G>T, p.E84*) within exon 3 of theZEB2gene. This novel alteration resulted in a termination codon at amino acid position 84, which was predicted to encode a truncated protein. This variant was not present in unrelated healthy control samples that were obtained from the exome sequence databases ExAc browser (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) and gnomAD browser (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). It is a novel variant that was determined to be a deleterious mutation according to the variant interpretation guidelines of the ACMG. The results of our study suggest that the p.E84* mutation in theZEB2gene was probably the pathogenic mutation that caused MWS in the proband.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study reports the novel mutation in the proband will provide a basic foundation for further investigations to elucidate the ZEB2-related mechanisms of MWS.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

32541556,Interactive Web Application for Plotting Personalized Prognosis Prediction Curves in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Using Machine Learning.,"<h4>Background</h4>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative treatment option for malignant hematological disorders. Transplant clinicians estimate patient-specific prognosis empirically in clinical practice based on previous studies on similar patients. However, this approach does not provide objective data. The present study primarily aimed to develop a tool capable of providing accurate personalized prognosis prediction after allo-HCT in an objective manner.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed an interactive web application tool with a graphical user interface capable of plotting the personalized survival and cumulative incidence prediction curves after allo-HCT adjusted by 8 patient-specific factors, which are known as prognostic predictors, and assessed their predictive performances. A random survival forest model using the data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at our institution was applied to develop this application.<h4>Results</h4>We succeeded in showing the personalized prognosis prediction curves of 1-year overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse/progression, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) interactively using our web application (https://predicted-os-after-transplantation.shinyapps.io/RSF_model/). To assess its predictive performance, the entire cohort (363 cases) was split into a training cohort (70%) and a test cohort (30%) time-sequentially based on the patients' transplant dates. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for 1-year overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse/progression, and nonrelapse mortality in test cohort were 0.70, 0.72, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new web application could allow transplant clinicians to inform a new allo-HCT candidate of the objective personalized prognosis prediction and facilitate decision-making.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32546899,Hypersensitivity reactions to biologics (part I): allergy as an important differential diagnosis in complex immune-derived adverse events.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Biotechnological substances (BSs) are strongly relied upon to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, and to treat oncological, allergological, and other inflammatory diseases. Allergic reactions to partly foreign biologics can occur due to their potential immunogenicity. The severity of an immune response to a biological drug may range from no clinical significance to a severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reaction.<b>Methods:</b> Detailed searches were performed on Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to include all available publications. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and British Columbia Cancer Agency Drug Manual databases were screened for hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), infusion reaction, injection site reaction, urticaria, and anaphylaxis for individual BSs.<b>Results:</b> Treatment with BSs can cause various types of HSR. These are mentioned in the literature with definitions such as allergic reactions, anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis, HSR, infusion reactions, injection site reactions, cytokine release syndrome, and urticaria. Due to the overlap in signs and symptoms in the reported descriptions, it is not always possible to differentiate these reactions properly according to their pathomechanism. Similarly, many data reported as anaphylaxis actually describe severe anaphylactic reactions (grades III or IV).<b>Conclusion:</b> There is an urgent need for a simpler symptom- or system-based classification and scoring system to create an awareness for HSRs to BSs. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HSRs and increased clinical experience in the treatment of side effects will provide timely control of unexpected reactions. As a result, immunotherapy with BSs will become safer in the future.<b>Cite this as Glsen A</b>, <b>Wedi B</b>, <b>Jappe U.

32551881,"Fine Particulate Matter and Poor Cognitive Function among Chinese Older Adults: Evidence from a Community-Based, 12-Year Prospective Cohort Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Research on the relationship between long-term exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter =2.5m (PM2.5) and poor cognitive function is lacking in developing countries, especially in highly polluted areas.<h4>Objectives</h4>We evaluated associations of long-term exposure to PM2.5 with poor cognitive function in a diverse, national sample of older adults in China.<h4>Methods</h4>This analysis included data on 13,324 older adults (5,879 who were 65-79 years of age, 3,052 who were 80-89 years of age, 2,634 who were 90-99 years of age, and 1,759 who were =100 years of age) with normal cognitive function at baseline from March 2002 to September 2014, with 64,648 person-years of follow-up. We used a geographic information system analysis to estimate the annual average satellite-derived PM2.5 concentration for the geocoded location of the participants' baseline residences. Poor cognitive function was defined as a score of less than 18 on the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Competing risk models were performed to explore the association of PM2.5 with poor cognitive function.<h4>Results</h4>Each 10-g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 5.1% increased risk of poor cognitive function [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.051; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.023, 1.079]. Compared to the lowest quartile of PM2.5 (<41.4 g/m3), adjusted HR values were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.33), 1.27 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.41), and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.34) for the second (=41.4-50.3 ug/m3), third (=50.3-60.7g/m3), and fourth (=60.7 g/m3) quartiles of PM2.5, respectively (<i>p</i> for trend <0.001). Subgroup analyses suggested stronger associations between PM2.5 and poor cognitive impairment in men than women. The association was positive in the 65- to 79- and =100-y age group but not significant and positive in the other two age groups with similar results.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PM2.5 was identified as a risk factor for poor cognitive function in Chinese older adults. Improving air quality may reduce the future population burden of poor cognitive function, especially in areas with high air pollution. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5304.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32611389,Proteus: An algorithm for proposing stabilizing mutation pairs based on interactions observed in known protein 3D structures.,"BACKGROUND:Protein engineering has many applications for industry, such as the development of new drugs, vaccines, treatment therapies, food, and biofuel production. A common way to engineer a protein is to perform mutations in functionally essential residues to optimize their function. However, the discovery of beneficial mutations for proteins is a complex task, with a time-consuming and high cost for experimental validation. Hence, computational approaches have been used to propose new insights for experiments narrowing the search space and reducing the costs. RESULTS:In this study, we developed Proteus (an acronym for Protein Engineering Supporter), a new algorithm for proposing mutation pairs in a target 3D structure. These suggestions are based on contacts observed in other known structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB). Proteus' basic assumption is that if a non-interacting pair of amino acid residues in the target structure is exchanged to an interacting pair, this could enhance protein stability. This trade is only allowed if the main-chain conformation of the residues involved in the contact is conserved. Furthermore, no steric impediment is expected between the proposed mutations and the surrounding protein atoms. To evaluate Proteus, we performed two case studies with proteins of industrial interests. In the first case study, we evaluated if the mutations suggested by Proteus for four protein structures enhance the number of inter-residue contacts. Our results suggest that most mutations proposed by Proteus increase the number of interactions into the protein. In the second case study, we used Proteus to suggest mutations for a lysozyme protein. Then, we compared Proteus' outcomes to mutations with available experimental evidence reported in the ProTherm database. Four mutations, in which our results agree with the experimental data, were found. This could be initial evidence that changes in the side-chain of some residues do not cause disturbances that harm protein structure stability. CONCLUSION:We believe that Proteus could be used combined with other methods to give new insights into the rational development of engineered proteins.

32626466,Application of data science in risk assessment and early warning.,"The food supply chain has been recognised by the EU as a critical infrastructure, and its complexity is the main cause of vulnerability. Depending on the food matrix, natural and/or deliberate contamination, food-borne diseases or even food fraud incidents may occur worldwide. Consequently, robust predictive models and/or software tools are needed to support decision-making and mitigating risks in an efficient and timely manner. In this frame, the fellow participated in data collection and analysis tasks, so as to provide additional predictive models. The working programme, covered a wide range of aspects related to risk assessment including identification of emerging risks (quantitative), microbiological risk assessment, authenticity assessment, spatio-temporal epidemiological modelling and database formation for hosting predictive microbial models. The training and close integration, in the open-source, in-house (German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR)) developed software tools under the framework of FoodRisk-Labs (https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de.) for data analysis, predictive microbiology, quantitative microbiological risk assessment and automatic data retrieval purposes allowed for the independent use. Moreover, the fellow actively contributed to the update of the upcoming Yersinia enterocolitica risk assessment, and also in authenticity assessment of edible oils. Over the course of the year, the fellow was closely involved in international and national research projects with experts in the above-mentioned disciplines. Lastly, he consolidated his acquired knowledge by presenting his scientific work to conferences, and BfR-internal meetings.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32645039,"UFO: A tool for unifying biomedical ontology-based semantic similarity calculation, enrichment analysis and visualization.","<h4>Background</h4>Biomedical ontologies have been growing quickly and proven to be useful in many biomedical applications. Important applications of those data include estimating the functional similarity between ontology terms and between annotated biomedical entities, analyzing enrichment for a set of biomedical entities. Many semantic similarity calculation and enrichment analysis methods have been proposed for such applications. Also, a number of tools implementing the methods have been developed on different platforms. However, these tools have implemented a small number of the semantic similarity calculation and enrichment analysis methods for a certain type of biomedical ontology. Note that the methods can be applied to all types of biomedical ontologies. More importantly, each method can be dominant in different applications; thus, users have more choice with more number of methods implemented in tools. Also, more functions would facilitate their task with ontology.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we developed a Cytoscape app, named UFO, which unifies most of the semantic similarity measures for between-term and between-entity similarity calculation for all types of biomedical ontologies in OBO format. Based on the similarity calculation, UFO can calculate the similarity between two sets of entities and weigh imported entity networks as well as generate functional similarity networks. Besides, it can perform enrichment analysis of a set of entities by different methods. Moreover, UFO can visualize structural relationships between ontology terms, annotating relationships between entities and terms, and functional similarity between entities. Finally, we demonstrated the ability of UFO through some case studies on finding the best semantic similarity measures for assessing the similarity between human disease phenotypes, constructing biomedical entity functional similarity networks for predicting disease-associated biomarkers, and performing enrichment analysis on a set of similar phenotypes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, UFO is expected to be a tool where biomedical ontologies can be exploited for various biomedical applications.<h4>Availability</h4>UFO is distributed as a Cytoscape app, and can be downloaded freely at Cytoscape App (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/ufo) for non-commercial use.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32647037,"An Analysis of Variability in """"CatWalk"""" Locomotor Measurements to Aid Experimental Design and Interpretation.","Preclinical studies in models of neurologic injury and disease rely on behavioral outcomes to measure intervention efficacy. For spinal cord injury, the CatWalk system provides unbiased quantitative assessment of subtle aspects of locomotor function in rodents and so can powerfully detect significant differences between experimental and control groups. Although clearly of key importance, summary group-level data can obscure the variability within and between individual subjects and therefore make it difficult to understand the magnitude of effect in individual animals and the proportion of a group that may show benefit. Here, we calculate reference change intervals (RCIs) that define boundaries of normal variability for measures of rat locomotion on the CatWalk. Our results indicate that many commonly-used outcome measures are highly variable, such that differences of up to 70% from baseline value must be considered normal variation. Many CatWalk outcome variables are also highly correlated and dependent on run speed. Application of calculated RCIs to open access data (https://scicrunch.org/odc-sci) on hindlimb stride length in spinal cord-injured rats illustrates the complementarity between group-level (16 mm change; <i>p</i> = 0.0009) and individual-level (5/32 animals show change outside RCI boundaries) analysis between week 3 and week 6 after injury. We also conclude that interdependence among CatWalk variables implies that test """"batteries"""" require careful composition to ensure that different aspects of defective gait are analyzed. Calculation of RCIs aids in experimental design by quantifying variability and enriches overall data analysis by providing details of change at an individual level that complement group-level analysis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32685640,Lipid profile dataset of optogenetics induced optic nerve regeneration.,"The optic nerve transfers visual information from the retina to the brain through the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In adult mammals, optic nerve injuries and progressive degenerative diseases lead to the irreversible loss of RGCs, resulting in vision loss and blindness. Optogenetic models have proved useful in manipulating the growth of RGCs through expression and stimulation of channelrhodopsins (Chr2) in RGCs using the RGC-specific thy-1 promoter. Using transgenic Chr2 mouse (Thy1-ChR2-EYFP) as a model of regeneration, we profile the lipid changes which occur after traumatic optic nerve crush, light stimulation and forced RGC axonal growth. Thy1-ChR2-EYFP and control (C57BL/6) mice were divided in four groups each - 1) no crush and no stimulation, 2) no crush with stimulation, 3) crush and without stimulation, and 4) crush with stimulation. After euthanasia, the optic nerves were collected for lipidomic analysis. The Bligh and Dyer method was used for lipid extraction, followed by mass spectrometry lipid profiling with a Q-Exactive Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC MS-MS). The raw scans were analysed with LipidSearch 4.1.3 and the statistical analysis was conducted through Metaboanalyst 4.0.

32700975,Cytotoxicity Burst? Differentiating Specific from Nonspecific Effects in Tox21 <i>in Vitro</i> Reporter Gene Assays.,"<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput screening of chemicals with <i>in vitro</i> reporter gene assays in Tox21 has produced a large database on cytotoxicity and specific modes of action. However, the validity of some of the reported activities is questionable due to the """"cytotoxicity burst,"""" which refers to the supposition that many stress responses are activated in a nonspecific way at concentrations close to cell death.<h4>Objectives</h4>We propose a pragmatic method to identify whether reporter gene activation is specific or cytotoxicity-triggered by comparing the measured effects with baseline toxicity.<h4>Methods</h4>Baseline toxicity, also termed narcosis, is the minimal toxicity any chemical causes. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) developed for baseline toxicity in mammalian reporter gene cell lines served as anchors to define the chemical-specific threshold for the cytotoxicity burst and to evaluate the degree of specificity of the reporter gene activation. Measured 10% effect concentrations were related to measured or QSAR-predicted 10% cytotoxicity concentrations yielding specificity ratios (SR). We applied this approach to our own experimental data and to ~8,000 chemicals that were tested in six of the high-throughput Tox21 reporter gene assays.<h4>Results</h4>Confirmed baseline toxicants activated reporter gene activity around cytotoxic concentrations triggered by the cytotoxicity burst. In six Tox21 assays, 37%-87% of the active hits were presumably caused by the cytotoxicity burst (SR<1) and only 2%-14% were specific with SR=10 against experimental cytotoxicity but 75%-97% were specific against baseline toxicity. This difference was caused by a large fraction of chemicals showing excess cytotoxicity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The specificity analysis for measured <i>in vitro</i> effects identified whether a cytotoxicity burst had likely occurred. The SR-analysis not only prevented false positives, but it may also serve as measure for relative effect potency and can be used for quantitative <i>in vitro-invivo</i> extrapolation and risk assessment of chemicals. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6664.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The tertiary structure and function of these proteins are determined by the type and copy number of the repeating units. Each repeat type exhibits a unique pattern of intra- and inter-repeat unit interactions that is well-captured by the topological features in the network representation of protein structures. Here we present an improved version of our graph based algorithm, PRIGSA, with structure-based validation and filtering steps incorporated for accurate detection of tandem structural repeats. The algorithm integrates available knowledge on repeat families with de novo prediction to detect repeats in single monomer chains as well as in multimeric protein complexes. Three levels of performance evaluation are presented: comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark dataset of repeat and nonrepeat proteins, accuracy in the detection of members of 13 known repeat families reported in UniProt and execution on the complete Protein Data Bank to show its ability to identify previously uncharacterized proteins. A ~3-fold increase in the coverage of the members of 13 known families and 3408 novel uncharacterized structural repeat proteins are identified on executing it on PDB.

32750793,Index Networks.,"We show that existing upsampling operators can be unified using the notion of the index function. This notion is inspired by an observation in the decoding process of deep image matting where indices-guided unpooling can often recover boundary details considerably better than other upsampling operators such as bilinear interpolation. By viewing the indices as a function of the feature map, we introduce the concept of 'learning to index', and present a novel index-guided encoder-decoder framework where indices are learned adaptively from data and are used to guide downsampling and upsampling stages, without extra training supervision. At the core of this framework is a new learnable module, termed Index Network (IndexNet), which dynamically generates indices conditioned on the feature map. IndexNet can be used as a plug-in applicable to almost all convolutional networks that have coupled downsampling and upsampling stages, enabling the networks to dynamically capture variations of local patterns. In particular, we instantiate, investigate five families of IndexNet, highlight their superiority in delivering spatial information over other upsampling operators with experiments on synthetic data, and demonstrate their effectiveness on four dense prediction tasks, including image matting, image denoising, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

32804088,Increasing Awareness and Use of Mobile Health Technology Among Individuals With Hypertension in a Rural Community of Bangladesh: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Hypertension remains one of the foremost noncommunicable diseases that most often lead to cardiovascular diseases and its different complications. The prevalence of hypertension in Bangladesh has been increasing. However, there are very limited studies that have evaluated the impact of health education and awareness development in mitigating the burden of hypertension and its complications in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE:This study aims to increase awareness, enhance knowledge, and change lifestyle behaviors through health education and the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology among individuals with hypertension living in a rural community of Bangladesh. METHODS:A randomized controlled trial is underway in a Mirzapur subdistrict of Bangladesh. This trial compares two groups of individuals with hypertension: The comparison arm receives health education and the intervention arm receives health education and a periodic mobile phone-based text message intervention. The trial duration is 5 months. The primary end point is participants' actual behavior changes brought about by increased awareness and knowledge. RESULTS:Enrollment of participants started in August 2018, and collection of follow-up data was completed at the end of July 2019. A total of 420 participants volunteered to participate, and among them, 209 and 211 were randomly allocated to the intervention group and the control group, respectively. Among them, the ratio of males/females was 12.0/88.0 in the intervention group and 16.1/83.9 in the control group. Data cleaning and analyses have been completed and the results have been submitted for publication. CONCLUSIONS:Periodic short education using mHealth technology in addition to face-to-face health education may be an effective method for increasing awareness and knowledge about behavioral changes and maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors.

32811511,Advancing brain barriers RNA sequencing: guidelines from experimental design to publication.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in its varied forms has become an indispensable tool for analyzing differential gene expression and thus characterization of specific tissues. Aiming to understand the brain barriers genetic signature, RNA seq has also been introduced in brain barriers research. This has led to availability of both, bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq datasets over the last few years. If appropriately performed, the RNA-Seq studies provide powerful datasets that allow for significant deepening of knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that establish the brain barriers. However, RNA-Seq studies comprise complex workflows that require to consider many options and variables before, during and after the proper sequencing process.<h4>Main body</h4>In the current manuscript, we build on the interdisciplinary experience of the European PhD Training Network BtRAIN ( https://www.btrain-2020.eu/ ) where bioinformaticians and brain barriers researchers collaborated to analyze and establish RNA-Seq datasets on vertebrate brain barriers. The obstacles BtRAIN has identified in this process have been integrated into the present manuscript. It provides guidelines along the entire workflow of brain barriers RNA-Seq studies starting from the overall experimental design to interpretation of results. Focusing on the vertebrate endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) and epithelial blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier (BCSFB) of the choroid plexus, we provide a step-by-step description of the workflow, highlighting the decisions to be made at each step of the workflow and explaining the strengths and weaknesses of individual choices made. Finally, we propose recommendations for accurate data interpretation and on the information to be included into a publication to ensure appropriate accessibility of the data and reproducibility of the observations by the scientific community.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Next generation transcriptomic profiling of the brain barriers provides a novel resource for understanding the development, function and pathology of these barrier cells, which is essential for understanding CNS homeostasis and disease. Continuous advancement and sophistication of RNA-Seq will require interdisciplinary approaches between brain barrier researchers and bioinformaticians as successfully performed in BtRAIN. The present guidelines are built on the BtRAIN interdisciplinary experience and aim to facilitate collaboration of brain barriers researchers with bioinformaticians to advance RNA-Seq study design in the brain barriers community.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Previously we published a workflow named <i>Mi</i>croorganism <i>C</i>lassification and <i>Id</i>entification (MiCId v.12.26.2017) that was shown to perform no worse than other workflows. This manuscript presents MiCId v.12.13.2018 that, in comparison with the earlier version v.12.26.2017, allows for biomass estimates, provides more accurate microorganism identifications (better controls the number of false positives), and is robust against database size increase. This significant advance is made possible by several new ingredients introduced: first, we apply a modified expectation-maximization method to compute for each taxon considered a prior probability, which can be used for biomass estimate; second, we introduce a new concept called ownership, through which the participation ratio is computed and use it as the number of taxa to be kept within a cluster of closely related taxa; third, based on confidently identified peptides, we calculate for each taxon its degree of independence from the rest of taxa considered to determine whether or not to split this taxon off the cluster. Using 270 data files, each containing a large number of MS/MS spectra, we show that, in comparison with v.12.26.2017, version v.12.13.2018 yields superior retrieval results. We also show that MiCId v.12.13.2018 can estimate species biomass reasonably well.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-12346-001.) In this qualitative study, we explored the experiences of clients receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for major depressive disorder. All participants received 8 sessions of traditional CBT (based on Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emergy, 1979) and 8 sessions of positive CBT (order counterbalanced). The aim of the study was to examine clients' experience of positive CBT and to contrast this with their experience of traditional CBT. Positive CBT structurally and selectively focuses on better moments (exceptions to the problem as opposed to the problem), strengths, and positive emotions and integrates traditional CBT with solution-focused brief therapy and positive psychology. In addition to conducting interviews with 12 individuals, the second author attended all therapy sessions of 4 clients and observed biweekly supervision sessions as further methods of data collection. Qualitative analysis showed that, despite initial skepticism, clients preferred positive CBT and indicated experiencing a steeper learning curve during positive, compared with traditional, CBT for depression. The popularity of positive CBT was attributable to 4 influences: feeling good and empowered, benefitting from upward spiral effects of positive emotions, learning to appreciate baby steps, and (re)discovering optimism as a personal strength. Qualitative analysis showed that, despite better moments and building positivity efficiently counters depressive symptoms and builds well-being. Clients perceived positive CBT's upbeat tone as stimulating and as motivating for change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Due to a lack of proven treatments, it is critical to explore novel treatments for HE and PHE to improve functional recovery after sICH.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a prospective, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and randomized clinical study of approximately 2400 patients with sICH. Patients within 4.5h of sICH onset that fulfilling the clinical criteria for diagnosis (e.g. age more than 18 years old, the Glasgow Coma Scal>7, and no planned surgery) will randomly receive either intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) 1 g 10-min bolus followed by 1g eight-hour infusion or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%). Clinical data including the ICH score and the Glasgow Coma Scale score will be collected on admission. After assessment of HE and PHE expansion, follow-up will be conducted with enrolled patients for 90 days.<h4>Results</h4>Primary outcome metrics are HE (defined as either >33% or >6ml increase from baseline) and PHE expansion rate at 24  3h and 72  3h post-sICH. Secondary outcome metrics include mortality and the modified Rankin Scale on day 90 after sICH. Appropriate statistic methods will be used to evaluate the efficacy of TXA on patients with sICH within 4.5h of symptom onset.<h4>Conclusions</h4>HE usually occurs within the first few hours after onset of symptoms. It is essential to evaluate the efficacy of TXA on HE within a narrow window of time. This will be the first trial to evaluate the efficacy of TXA on HE and PHE expansion in sICH patients within 4.5h after symptom onset.

32964354,A novel online calculator predicting short-term postoperative outcomes in patients with metastatic brain tumors.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Establishing predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS), discharge deposition, and total hospital charges is essential to providing high-quality, value-based care. Though previous research has investigated these outcomes for patients with metastatic brain tumors, there are currently no tools that synthesize such research findings and allow for prediction of these outcomes on a patient-by-patient basis. The present study sought to develop a prediction calculator that uses patient demographic and clinical information to predict extended hospital length of stay, non-routine discharge disposition, and high total hospital charges for patients with metastatic brain tumors.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients undergoing surgery for metastatic brain tumors at a single academic institution were analyzed (2017-2019). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of extended LOS (> 7days), non-routine discharge, and high total hospital charges (> $46,082.63). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. C-statistics and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to assess model discrimination and calibration, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 235 patients were included in our analysis, with a mean age of 62.74years. The majority of patients were female (52.3%) and Caucasian (76.6%). Our models predicting extended LOS, non-routine discharge, and high hospital charges had optimism-corrected c-statistics > 0.7, and all three models demonstrated adequate calibration (p > 0.05). The final models are available as an online calculator ( https://neurooncsurgery.shinyapps.io/brain_mets_calculator/ ).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our models predicting postoperative outcomes allow for individualized risk-estimation for patients following surgery for metastatic brain tumors. Our results may be useful in helping clinicians to provide resource-conscious, high-value care.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
32978618,Deep learning based prediction of reversible HAT/HDAC-specific lysine acetylation.,"Protein lysine acetylation regulation is an important molecular mechanism for regulating cellular processes and plays critical physiological and pathological roles in cancers and diseases. Although massive acetylation sites have been identified through experimental identification and high-throughput proteomics techniques, their enzyme-specific regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we developed the deep learning-based protein lysine acetylation modification prediction (Deep-PLA) software for histone acetyltransferase (HAT)/histone deacetylase (HDAC)-specific acetylation prediction based on deep learning. Experimentally identified substrates and sites of several HATs and HDACs were curated from the literature to generate enzyme-specific data sets. We integrated various protein sequence features with deep neural network and optimized the hyperparameters with particle swarm optimization, which achieved satisfactory performance. Through comparisons based on cross-validations and testing data sets, the model outperformed previous studies. Meanwhile, we found that protein-protein interactions could enrich enzyme-specific acetylation regulatory relations and visualized this information in the Deep-PLA web server. Furthermore, a cross-cancer analysis of acetylation-associated mutations revealed that acetylation regulation was intensively disrupted by mutations in cancers and heavily implicated in the regulation of cancer signaling. These prediction and analysis results might provide helpful information to reveal the regulatory mechanism of protein acetylation in various biological processes to promote the research on prognosis and treatment of cancers. Therefore, the Deep-PLA predictor and protein acetylation interaction networks could provide helpful information for studying the regulation of protein acetylation.

The correct sentence should have read as follows: """"(b) direct assessments of strength of faith or positive impression management were not included or measured independently."""" All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-54974-001.) The traditional background hypothesis (TBH) is a long-standing belief associated with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) L scale; a validity scale, which appears on every version of the family of MMPI instruments including the soon-to-be released MMPI-3. The L scale was originally designed to assess whether test respondents presented themselves in an unrealistically favorable light. Both researchers and clinicians noted, however, that those from traditional Christian faith-based groups produced elevated L-scale scores. A recent meta-analysis supported this observation, reporting an average L-scale elevation 0.50 SD greater than the MMPI-2 normative sample compared to samples of those with presumptively strong Christian-Judeo faith. Some limitations of this meta-analysis are that (a) the samples used in it included those undergoing an evaluative assessment, which could elevate L-scale scores independent of strength of faith belief, and (b) direct assessments of strength of faith or positive impression management were included or measured independently. Our primary goal in this study was to examine the TBH addressing these limitations with a sample of those who self-identified as believers in the Muslim faith (N = 267), the examination of which expands the scope beyond those of the Christian-Judeo faith. Consistent with previous results, the mean L-r (MMPI/MMPI-2 L scale counterpart on the MMPI-2-Restructured Form) was 56.41 T. Higher L-r scale scores were associated with increasing strength in the Muslim faith, and although increasing L-r scores were primarily associated with impression management, increasing Muslim-based faith values had a nontrivial influence on L-r scores and especially in the moderate score range of this scale.

32997632,Interhemispheric Functional Reorganization and its Structural Base After BCI-Guided Upper-Limb Training in Chronic Stroke.,"Brain-computer interface (BCI)-guided robot-assisted upper-limb training has been increasingly applied to stroke rehabilitation. However, the induced long-term neuroplasticity modulation still needs to be further characterized. This study investigated the functional reorganization and its structural base after BCI-guided robot-assisted training using resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The clinical improvement and the neurological changes before, immediately after, and six months after 20-session BCI-guided robot hand training were explored in 14 chronic stroke subjects. The structural base of the induced functional reorganization and motor improvement were also investigated using DTI. Repeated measure ANOVA indicated long-term motor improvement was found (F[2, 26] = 6.367, p = 0.006). Significantly modulated functional connectivity (FC) was observed between ipsilesional motor regions (M1 and SMA) and some contralesional areas (SMA, PMd, SPL) in the seed-based analysis. Modulated FC with ipsilesional M1 was significantly correlated with motor function improvement (r = 0.6455, p = 0.0276). Besides, increased interhemispheric FC among the sensorimotor area from resting-state data and increased laterality index from task-based data together indicated the re-balance of the two hemispheres during the recovery. Multiple linear regression models suggested that both motor function improvement and the functional change between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional premotor area were significantly associated with the ipsilesional corticospinal tract integrity. The results in the current study provided solid support for stroke recovery mechanism in terms of interhemispheric interaction and its structural substrates, which could further enhance the understanding of BCI training in stroke rehabilitation.

33042605,LibMI: An Open Source Library for Efficient Histopathological Image Processing.,"<h4>Background</h4>Whole-slide images (WSIs) as a kind of image data are rapidly growing in the digital pathology domain. With unusual high resolution, these images make them hard to be supported by conventional tools or file formats. Thus, it obstructs data sharing and automated analysis. Here, we propose a library, LibMI, along with its open and standardized image file format. They can be used together to efficiently read, write, modify, and annotate large images.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>LibMI utilizes the concept of pyramid image structure and lazy propagation from a segment tree algorithm to support reading and modifying and to guarantee that both operations have linear time complexity. Further, a cache mechanism was introduced to speed up the program.<h4>Results</h4>LibMI is an open and efficient library for histopathological image processing. To demonstrate its functions, we applied it to several tasks including image thresholding, microscopic color correction, and storing pixel-wise information on WSIs. The result shows that libMI is particularly suitable for modifying large images. Furthermore, compared with congeneric libraries and file formats, libMI and modifiable multiscale image (MMSI) run 18.237 times faster on read-only tasks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The combination of libMI library and MMSI file format enables developers to efficiently read and modify WSIs, thus can assist in pixel-wise image processing on extremely large images to promote building image processing pipeline. The library together with the data schema is freely available on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/BioAI/libMI.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33048108,A comprehensive comparison of residue-level methylation levels with the regression-based gene-level methylation estimations by ReGear.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>DNA methylation is a biological process impacting the gene functions without changing the underlying DNA sequence. The DNA methylation machinery usually attaches methyl groups to some specific cytosine residues, which modify the chromatin architectures. Such modifications in the promoter regions will inactivate some tumor-suppressor genes. DNA methylation within the coding region may significantly reduce the transcription elongation efficiency. The gene function may be tuned through some cytosines are methylated.<h4>Methods</h4>This study hypothesizes that the overall methylation level across a gene may have a better association with the sample labels like diseases than the methylations of individual cytosines. The gene methylation level is formulated as a regression model using the methylation levels of all the cytosines within this gene. A comprehensive evaluation of various feature selection algorithms and classification algorithms is carried out between the gene-level and residue-level methylation levels.<h4>Results</h4>A comprehensive evaluation was conducted to compare the gene and cytosine methylation levels for their associations with the sample labels and classification performances. The unsupervised clustering was also improved using the gene methylation levels. Some genes demonstrated statistically significant associations with the class label, even when no residue-level methylation features have statistically significant associations with the class label. So in summary, the trained gene methylation levels improved various methylome-based machine learning models. Both methodology development of regression algorithms and experimental validation of the gene-level methylation biomarkers are worth of further investigations in the future studies.

33058887,How the CORAL software can be used to select compounds for efficient treatment of neurodegenerative diseases?,"Recommendations on the efficient application of CORAL software (http://www.insilico.eu/coral) to establish quantitative structure-property/activity relationships (QSPRs/QSARs) are provided. The predictive potential of the approach has been demonstrated for QSAR models developed for inhibitor concentrations (negative decimal logarithm of IC50) of derivatives of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), and tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA). The above three protein targets are related to various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Each model was checked using several splits of the data for the training and the validation sets. The index of ideality of correlation (IIC) represents a tool to improve the predictive potential for an arbitrary model. However, the use of the IIC should be carried out according to rules, described in this work.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33064603,Exploring Sentence Diversity at the Boundary of Typical and Impaired Language Abilities.,"Purpose This review article summarizes programmatic research on sentence diversity in toddlers developing language typically and explores developmental patterns of sentence diversity in toddlers at risk for specific language impairment. Method The first half of this review article presents a sentence-focused approach to language assessment and intervention and reviews findings from empirical studies of sentence diversity. In the second half, subject and verb diversity in three simple sentence types are explored in an archival database of toddlers with varying levels of grammatical outcomes at 36 months of age: low average, mild/moderate delay, and severe delay. Results Descriptive findings from the archival database replicated previous developmental patterns. All toddlers with low-average language abilities produced diverse simple sentences by 30 months of age and exhibited greater sentence diversity with first-person <i>I</i>-subjects before third-person subjects. Third-person subject diversity emerged in a developmental sequence, increasing in one-argument copula contexts and one-argument subject-verb sentences before two-argument subject-verb-object sentences. This developmental pattern held across all three outcome groups. Third-person subjects were least diverse for children with severe grammatical delays and were absent in all sentence contexts for two children with severe delays at 36 months. Conclusions Sentence diversity increases gradually and expands in predictable patterns. Understanding these developmental patterns may help identify and treat children who display unexpected difficulty combining different subjects and verbs in flexible ways.

33130899,Functional analysis of low-grade glioma genetic variants predicts key target genes and transcription factors.,"<h4>Background</h4>Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated thousands of germline genetic variants in modulating individuals' risk to various diseases, including cancer. At least 25 risk loci have been identified for low-grade gliomas (LGGs), but their molecular functions remain largely unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>We hypothesized that GWAS loci contain causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reside in accessible open chromatin regions and modulate the expression of target genes by perturbing the binding affinity of transcription factors (TFs). We performed an integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other public repositories to identify candidate causal SNPs within linkage disequilibrium blocks of LGG GWAS loci. We assessed their potential regulatory role via in silico TF binding sequence perturbations, convolutional neural network trained on TF binding data, and simulated annealing-based interpretation methods.<h4>Results</h4>We built an interactive website (http://education.knoweng.org/alg3/) summarizing the functional footprinting of 280 variants in 25 LGG GWAS regions, providing rich information for further computational and experimental scrutiny. We identified as case studies PHLDB1 and SLC25A26 as candidate target genes of rs12803321 and rs11706832, respectively, and predicted the GWAS variant rs648044 to be the causal SNP modulating ZBTB16, a known tumor suppressor in multiple cancers. We showed that rs648044 likely perturbed the binding affinity of the TF MAFF, as supported by RNA interference and in vitro MAFF binding experiments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The identified candidate (causal SNP, target gene, TF) triplets and the accompanying resource will help accelerate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic risk factors for gliomas.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33140980,Determinants and impact of physical impairment in patient-reported outcomes among older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japan.,"<h4>Objective</h4>To investigate the predictive factors associated with physical impairment among older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Japan and to examine the potential impact of physical impairment on patient-reported health outcomes in this population.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using patient-reported data from the 2012-2014 Japan National Health and Wellness Survey. Physical impairment was measured using the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score of the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) three-component model (using Japanese norms). Older T2DM patients (=65 years old; <i>n</i> = 1511) were dichotomized into physically impaired (PCS = 25th percentile; <i>n</i> = 378) and non-physically impaired (PCS > 25th percentile; <i>n</i> = 1133). Work productivity (absenteeism, presenteeism and overall work impairment), activity impairment and healthcare resource utilization were compared between these groups.<h4>Results</h4>Age, female sex, low and high body mass index (BMI), diabetes-related complications, cardiovascular events, unawareness of having hypoglycemic events in the past 3 months, and lack of regular exercise were significant factors associated with physical impairment in multivariable analysis. The physically impaired group reported significantly more regular outpatient visits (13.48 vs. 10.16, respectively, <i>p</i> < .001), 1% or greater absenteeism (16.7% vs. 4.1%, <i>p</i> = .005), greater presenteeism (27.8% vs. 12.2%, <i>p</i> = .001), overall work impairment (30.0% vs. 13.0%, <i>p</i> = .001) and overall activity impairment (39.5% vs. 17.2%, <i>p <</i> .001) than the non-physically-impaired group after adjusting for covariates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identified age, BMI, diabetes-related comorbidities, history of cardiovascular events and lack of exercise as key predictors associated with physical impairment in older patients with T2DM in Japan, which predicted low work productivity as well as activity impairment. This study provides support that physical impairment in patients with T2DM may lead to low work productivity and activity impairment.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2020.1846170.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33186370,Individual and community level factors associated with anemia among children 6-59 months of age in Ethiopia: A further analysis of 2016 Ethiopia demographic and health survey.,"<h4>Background</h4>Anemia is a global public health problem; but its burden is disproportionately borne among children in the African Regions. The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey report showed that the prevalence of anemia among children 6-59 months of age was 57%; far exceeding the national target of 25% set for 2015. Although studies have been conducted in Ethiopia, multilevel analysis has rarely been used to identify factors associated with anemia among children. Therefore, this study aimed to identify individual and community-level factors associated with anemia among children 6-59 months of age by fitting a multilevel logistic regression model.<h4>Methods</h4>The data was obtained from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, conducted from January to June 2016, and downloaded from the website http://www.DHSprogram.com. The sample was taken using two-stage stratified sampling. In stage one, 645 Enumeration Areas and in stage two 28 households per Enumeration Area were selected. A sample of 7790 children 6-59 months of age was included. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was obtained.<h4>Result</h4>From the individual-level factors, anemia was associated most strongly with child age, wealth index, maternal anemia and child stunting followed by child underweight, child fever and birth order whereas from the community-level, the strongest odds of anemia occurred among children from Somali, Harari, Dire Dawa and Afar region followed by Oromia and Addis Ababa. Low community-poverty is a protective factor for anemia. The odds of anemia were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99) times lower for children who were living in communities of lower poverty status than children who were living in communities of higher poverty status. Children from Somali and Dire Dawa had 3.38 (95% CI: 3.25, 5.07) and 2.22 (95% CI: 1.42, 3.48) times higher odds of anemia, respectively than children from the Tigray region.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study shows that anemia among children 6-59 months of age is affected both by the individual and community level factors. It is better to strengthen the strategies of early detection and management of stunted and underweight children. At the same time, interventions should be strengthened to address maternal anemia, child fever and poverty, specifically targeting regions identified to have a high risk of anemia.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33190499,LigMate: A Multifeature Integration Algorithm for Ligand-Similarity-Based Virtual Screening.,"Ligand-similarity-based virtual screening is one of the most applicable computer-aided drug design techniques. The current methodology relies heavily on several descriptors of molecular features, including atoms (zero-dimensional, 0D), the presence or absence of structural features (one-dimensional, 1D), topological descriptors (two-dimensional, 2D), geometry and volume (three-dimensional, 3D), or stereoelectronic and stereodynamic properties (four-dimensional, 4D). These descriptors have been frequently used in virtual screening; however, they are usually used independently without integration, which may hinder effective and precise virtual screening. In this study, we developed a multifeature integration algorithm named LigMate, which employs a Hungarian algorithm-based matching and a machine learning-based nonlinear combination of various descriptors, including the new relevant descriptors focusing on the maximum common substructures (maximum common substructure score, MCSS), the relative distance of atoms from the ligand mass center (intraligand distance score, ILDS), as well as the ring differences (ring score, RS). In the benchmark tests, LigMate achieved an overall enrichment factor of the first percent (EF1) of 36.14 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.81 on the DUD-E data set, as well as an EF1 of 15.44 and an AUC of 0.69 on the maximum unbiased validation (MUV) data set, outperforming the control methods that are based on single descriptors. Thus, our study provides a new framework for multiple feature integration, which can benefit ligand-similarity-based virtual screening.

It is an updated version of AlgPred developed in 2006. The dataset used for training, testing and validation consists of 10075 allergens and 10075 non-allergens. In addition, 10451 experimentally validated immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitopes were used to identify antigenic regions in a protein. All models were trained on 80% of data called training dataset, and the performance of models was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation technique. The performance of the final model trained on the training dataset was evaluated on 20% of data called validation dataset; no two proteins in any two sets have more than 40% similarity. First, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search has been performed against the dataset, and allergens were predicted based on the level of similarity with known allergens. Second, IgE epitopes obtained from the IEDB database were searched in the dataset to predict allergens based on their presence in a protein. Third, motif-based approaches like multiple EM for motif elicitation/motif alignment and search tool have been used to predict allergens. Fourth, allergen prediction models have been developed using a wide range of machine learning techniques. Finally, the ensemble approach has been used for predicting allergenic protein by combining prediction scores of different approaches. Our best model achieved maximum performance in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.98 with Matthew's correlation coefficient 0.85 on the validation dataset. A web server AlgPred 2.0 has been developed that allows the prediction of allergens, mapping of IgE epitope, motif search and BLAST search (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/algpred2/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,"tool only , I think"
33244798,Comparing the motivational value of rewards and losses in an EEG-pupillometry study.,"We found earlier that performance-contingent rewards lead to faster performance than equivalent losses [Carsten, Hoofs, Boehler, & Krebs, 2019. Motivation Science, 5(3). http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/mot0000117]. Here, we further tested the hypothesis that motivation to gain rewards is higher than to avoid losses, even when incentive values are matched. As implicit markers of motivation, we assessed electroencephalography (EEG) focusing on the P3 after target and feedback onset, and the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), as well as simultaneously recorded pupil size. Comparing only reward and loss prospect trials in Experiment 1, we found no consistent differences in behavior and electrophysiological markers of motivation, although pupil data suggested higher arousal after feedback in potential-loss trials. Including additional no-incentive trials in Experiment 2, we found consistent evidence that motivation to gain rewards was higher than to avoid losses: In line with behavior, the target-P3 was most pronounced for reward-related stimuli, followed by loss and no-incentive ones. This same ranking was found in the P3 and the FRN after positive outcomes (i.e., reward, avoided loss, and correct feedback in no-incentive trials). Negative outcomes featured a different pattern in line with the pupil response, which suggests that losses are emotionally salient events, without invigorating behavior proportionally. In sum, these findings suggest that the motivation to gain rewards is more pronounced than motivation to avoid equivalent losses, at least in tasks promoting transient increases in attention triggered by incentive prospect. These motivational differences may arise as avoided losses are not profitable in the long term, in contrast to gained rewards.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33245691,NonClasGP-Pred: robust and efficient prediction of non-classically secreted proteins by integrating subset-specific optimal models of imbalanced data.,"Non-classically secreted proteins (NCSPs) are proteins that are located in the extracellular environment, although there is a lack of known signal peptides or secretion motifs. They usually perform different biological functions in intracellular and extracellular environments, and several of their biological functions are linked to bacterial virulence and cell defence. Accurate protein localization is essential for all living organisms, however, the performance of existing methods developed for NCSP identification has been unsatisfactory and in particular suffer from data deficiency and possible overfitting problems. Further improvement is desirable, especially to address the lack of informative features and mining subset-specific features in imbalanced datasets. In the present study, a new computational predictor was developed for NCSP prediction of gram-positive bacteria. First, to address the possible prediction bias caused by the data imbalance problem, ten balanced subdatasets were generated for ensemble model construction. Then, the F-score algorithm combined with sequential forward search was used to strengthen the feature representation ability for each of the training subdatasets. Third, the subset-specific optimal feature combination process was adopted to characterize the original data from different aspects, and all subdataset-based models were integrated into a unified model, NonClasGP-Pred, which achieved an excellent performance with an accuracy of 93.23 %, a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 89.01 %, a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 87.68 % and an area under the curve value of 0.9975 for ten-fold cross-validation.

33295759,Skin Doctor CP: Conformal Prediction of the Skin Sensitization Potential of Small Organic Molecules.,"Skin sensitization potential or potency is an important end point in the safety assessment of new chemicals and new chemical mixtures. Formerly, animal experiments such as the local lymph node assay (LLNA) were the main form of assessment. Today, however, the focus lies on the development of nonanimal testing approaches (i.e., in vitro and in chemico assays) and computational models. In this work, we investigate, based on publicly available LLNA data, the ability of aggregated, Mondrian conformal prediction classifiers to differentiate between non- sensitizing and sensitizing compounds as well as between two levels of skin sensitization potential (weak to moderate sensitizers, and strong to extreme sensitizers). The advantage of the conformal prediction framework over other modeling approaches is that it assigns compounds to activity classes only if a defined minimum level of confidence is reached for the individual predictions. This eliminates the need for applicability domain criteria that often are arbitrary in their nature and less flexible. Our new binary classifier, named Skin Doctor CP, differentiates nonsensitizers from sensitizers with a higher reliability-to-efficiency ratio than the corresponding nonconformal prediction workflow that we presented earlier. When tested on a set of 257 compounds at the significance levels of 0.10 and 0.30, the model reached an efficiency of 0.49 and 0.92, and an accuracy of 0.83 and 0.75, respectively. In addition, we developed a ternary classification workflow to differentiate nonsensitizers, weak to moderate sensitizers, and strong to extreme sensitizers. Although this model achieved satisfactory overall performance (accuracies of 0.90 and 0.73, and efficiencies of 0.42 and 0.90, at significance levels 0.10 and 0.30, respectively), it did not obtain satisfying class-wise results (at a significance level of 0.30, the validities obtained for nonsensitizers, weak to moderate sensitizers, and strong to extreme sensitizers were 0.70, 0.58, and 0.63, respectively). We argue that the model is, in consequence, unable to reliably identify strong to extreme sensitizers and suggest that other ternary models derived from the currently accessible LLNA data might suffer from the same problem. Skin Doctor CP is available via a public web service at https://nerdd.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/skinDoctorII/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33295914,iDHS-DASTS: identifying DNase I hypersensitive sites based on LASSO and stacking learning.,"The DNase I hypersensitivity site is an important marker of the DNA regulatory region, and its identification in the DNA sequence is of great significance for biomedical research. However, traditional identification methods are extremely time-consuming and can not obtain an accurate result. In this paper, we proposed a predictor called iDHS-DASTS to identify the DHS based on benchmark datasets. First, we adopt a feature extraction method called PseDNC which can incorporate the original DNA properties and spatial information of the DNA sequence. Then we use a method called LASSO to reduce the dimensions of the original data. Finally, we utilize stacking learning as a classifier, which includes Adaboost, random forest, gradient boosting, extra trees and SVM. Before we train the classifier, we use SMOTE-Tomek to overcome the imbalance of the datasets. In the experiment, our iDHS-DASTS achieves remarkable performance on three benchmark datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results with over 92.06%, 91.06% and 90.72% accuracy for datasets [Doublestruck S]1, [Doublestruck S]2 and [Doublestruck S]3, respectively. To verify the validation and transferability of our model, we establish another independent dataset [Doublestruck S]4, for which the accuracy can reach 90.31%. Furthermore, we used the proposed model to construct a user friendly web server called iDHS-DASTS, which is available at http://www.xdu-duan.cn/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33355345,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guideline on Neuroablative Procedures for Patients With Cancer Pain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Managing cancer pain once it is refractory to conventional treatment continues to challenge caregivers committed to serving those who are suffering from a malignancy. Although neuromodulation has a role in the treatment of cancer pain for some patients, these therapies may not be suitable for all patients. Therefore, neuroablative procedures, which were once a mainstay in treating intractable cancer pain, are again on the rise. This guideline serves as a systematic review of the literature of the outcomes following neuroablative procedures.<h4>Objective</h4>To establish clinical practice guidelines for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of neuroablative procedures used to treat patients with cancer pain from 1980 to April 2019 was performed using the United States National Library of Medicine PubMed database, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. After inclusion criteria were established, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed by 2 members of the task force and the quality of the evidence was graded.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 14 646 relevant abstracts were identified by the literature search, from which 189 met initial screening criteria. After full text review, 58 of the 189 articles were included and subdivided into 4 different clinical scenarios. These include unilateral somatic nociceptive/neuropathic body cancer pain, craniofacial cancer pain, midline subdiaphragmatic visceral cancer pain, and disseminated cancer pain. Class II and III evidence was available for these 4 clinical scenarios. Level III recommendations were developed for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neuroablative procedures may be an option for treating patients with refractory cancer pain. Serious adverse events were reported in some studies, but were relatively uncommon. Improved imaging, refinements in technique and the availability of new lesioning modalities may minimize the risks of neuroablation even further.The full guidelines can be accessed at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/guidelines-on-neuroablative-procedures-patients-wi.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33367514,BiCoN: Network-constrained biclustering of patients and omics data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Unsupervised learning approaches are frequently employed to stratify patients into clinically relevant subgroups and to identify biomarkers such as disease-associated genes. However, clustering and biclustering techniques are oblivious to the functional relationship of genes and are thus not ideally suited to pinpoint molecular mechanisms along with patient subgroups.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the network-constrained biclustering approach BiCoN (Biclustering Constrained by Networks) which (i) restricts biclusters to functionally related genes connected in molecular interaction networks and (ii) maximizes the difference in gene expression between two subgroups of patients. This allows BiCoN to simultaneously pinpoint molecular mechanisms responsible for the patient grouping. Network-constrained clustering of genes makes BiCoN more robust to noise and batch effects than typical clustering and biclustering methods. BiCoN can faithfully reproduce known disease subtypes as well as novel, clinically relevant patient subgroups, as we could demonstrate using breast and lung cancer datasets.

33381851,Dementia key gene identification with multi-layered SNP-gene-disease network.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Recently, various approaches for diagnosing and treating dementia have received significant attention, especially in identifying key genes that are crucial for dementia. If the mutations of such key genes could be tracked, it would be possible to predict the time of onset of dementia and significantly aid in developing drugs to treat dementia. However, gene finding involves tremendous cost, time and effort. To alleviate these problems, research on utilizing computational biology to decrease the search space of candidate genes is actively conducted.In this study, we propose a framework in which diseases, genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are represented by a layered network, and key genes are predicted by a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm utilizes a network-based semi-supervised learning model that can be applied to layered data structures.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed method was applied to a dataset extracted from public databases related to diseases and genes with data collected from 186 patients. A portion of key genes obtained using the proposed method was verified in silico through PubMed literature, and the remaining genes were left as possible candidate genes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The code for the framework will be available at http://www.alphaminers.net/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33402389,Hypoxia-Induced Suppression of Alternative Splicing of MBD2 Promotes Breast Cancer Metastasis via Activation of FZD1.,"Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths, however, the mechanisms underlying metastasis in this disease remain largely elusive. Here we report that under hypoxic conditions, alternative splicing of MBD2 is suppressed, favoring the production of MBD2a, which facilitates breast cancer metastasis. Specifically, MBD2a promoted, whereas its lesser known short form MBD2c suppressed metastasis. Activation of HIF1 under hypoxia facilitated MBD2a production via repression of SRSF2-mediated alternative splicing. As a result, elevated MBD2a outcompeted MBD2c for binding to promoter CpG islands to activate expression of FZD1, thereby promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. Strikingly, clinical data reveal significantly correlated expression of MBD2a and MBD2c with the invasiveness of malignancy, indicating opposing roles for MBD2 splicing variants in regulating human breast cancer metastasis. Collectively, our findings establish a novel link between MBD2 switching and tumor metastasis and provide a promising therapeutic strategy and predictive biomarkers for hypoxia-driven breast cancer metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study defines the opposing roles and clinical relevance of MBD2a and MBD2c, two MBD2 alternative splicing products, in hypoxia-driven breast cancer metastasis.

33457124,GAPDH and PUM1: Optimal Housekeeping Genes for Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction-Based Analysis of Cancer Stem Cells and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Expression in Rectal Tumors.,"Background The overwhelming majority of published articles have taken colon and rectal cancer as a single group, i.e., colorectal cancer, when normalizing gene expression data with housekeeping genes (HKG) in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments though there are published reports that suggest the differential expression pattern of genes between the colon and rectal cancer groups and hence the current experiment wasattempted to find out the optimal set ofhousekeeping genes from the list of common HKG for rectal tumor gene expression analysis. Methods The expression of fivepotential housekeeping genes GAPDH, RPNI, PUM1, B2M, and PMM1was analyzed through qPCR and Bestkeeper software (http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/bestkeeper.html) in 20 stage II-IV rectal cancer samplesto check for uniformity in their expression pattern. Cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ALDH1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker (EMT) markers E cadherin, vimentin, Twist,and SNAI2 expression were evaluated in conjunction with the two optimal reference genes in10 rectal cancers as part of validation. Results The standard deviation of the cycle threshold value of GAPDH was found the lowest at 0.65 followed by RPN1 at 0.88, PUM1 at 0.94, PMM1 at 0.94, and B2M at 1.21 when analyzed with BestKeeper software. Using GAPDH and PUM1 as the reference gene for the validation phase, rectal cancer patients with stageIII/IV showed a 4.79-fold change (P=0.006) in ALDH1 expression, and an 11.76-fold change in Twist expression (P=0.003) with respect to stage II rectal tumor when normalized with GAPDH and PUM1. Conclusion GAPDH and PUM1 can be used as an optimal set of housekeeping genes for gene expression-related experiments in rectal tumors. ALDH1 and Twist were found significantly overexpressed in stage III/IV rectal tumors in comparison to stage II rectal cancer. Genes associated withcancer stem cells and EMT markers could be optimally analyzed by normalizing them with GAPDH and PUM1 as housekeeping genes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33483306,Locus of Heat Resistance (LHR) in Meat-Borne Escherichia coli: Screening and Genetic Characterization.,"Microbial resistance to processing treatments poses a food safety concern, as treatment tolerant pathogens can emerge. Occasional foodborne outbreaks caused by pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> have led to human and economic losses. Therefore, this study screened for the extreme heat resistance (XHR) phenotype as well as one known genetic marker, the locus of heat resistance (LHR), in 4,123 <i>E. coli</i> isolates from diverse meat animals at different processing stages. The prevalences of XHR and LHR among the meat-borne <i>E. coli</i> were found to be 10.3% and 11.4%, respectively, with 19% agreement between the two. Finished meat products showed the highest LHR prevalence (24.3%) compared to other processing stages (0 to 0.6%). None of the LHR<sup>+</sup> <i>E. coli</i> in this study would be considered pathogens based on screening for virulence genes. Four high-quality genomes were generated by whole-genome sequencing of representative LHR<sup>+</sup> isolates. Nine horizontally acquired LHRs were identified and characterized, four plasmid-borne and five chromosomal. Nine newly identified LHRs belong to ClpK1 LHR or ClpK2 LHR variants sharing 61 to 68% nucleotide sequence identity, while one LHR appears to be a hybrid. Our observations suggest positive correlation between the number of LHR regions present in isolates and the extent of heat resistance. The isolate exhibiting the highest degree of heat resistance possessed four LHRs belonging to three different variant groups. Maintenance of as many as four LHRs in a single genome emphasizes the benefits of the LHR in bacterial physiology and stress response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Currently, a """"multiple-hurdle"""" approach based on a combination of different antimicrobial interventions, including heat, is being utilized during meat processing to control the burden of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. Our recent study (M. Guragain, G. E. Smith, D. A. King, and J. M. Bosilevac, J Food Prot 83:1438-1443, 2020, https://doi.org/10.4315/JFP-20-103) suggests that U.S. beef cattle harbor <i>Escherichia coli</i> that possess the locus of heat resistance (LHR). LHR seemingly contributes to the global stress tolerance in bacteria and hence poses a food safety concern. Therefore, it is important to understand the distribution of the LHRs among meat-borne bacteria identified at different stages of different meat processing systems. Complete genome sequencing and comparative analysis of selected heat-resistant bacteria provide a clearer understanding of stress and heat resistance mechanisms. Further, sequencing data may offer a platform to gain further insights into the genetic background that provides optimal bacterial tolerance against heat and other processing treatments.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33523611,Developing an evidence-based online method of linking behaviour change techniques and theoretical mechanisms of action: a multiple methods study,"<h4>Background</h4>Many global health challenges may be targeted by changing peoples behaviour. Behaviours including cigarette smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol misuse, as well as certain dietary behaviours, contribute to deaths and disability by increasing the risk of cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Interventions have been designed to change these health behaviours with a view to reducing these health risks. However, the effectiveness of these interventions has been quite variable and further information is needed to enhance their success. More information is needed about the specific processes that underlie the effectiveness of intervention strategies.<h4>Aim</h4>Researchers have developed a taxonomy of 93 behaviour change techniques (i.e. the active components of an intervention that bring about behavioural change), but little is known regarding their potential mechanisms of action (i.e. the processes through which a behaviour change technique affects behaviour). We therefore aimed to examine links between behaviour change techniques and mechanisms of action.<h4>Method</h4>First, we conducted a literature synthesis study of 277 behaviour change intervention studies, from which we extracted information on links, described by authors, between behaviour change techniques and mechanisms of action, and identified an average of 10 links per intervention report. Second, behaviour change experts (n = 105) were engaged in a three-round consensus study in which they discussed and rated their confidence in the presence/absence of links and non-links between commonly used behaviour change techniques (n = 61) and a set of mechanisms of action (n = 26). Ninety links and 460 non-links reached the pre-set threshold of 80% agreement. To enhance the validity of these results, a third study was conducted that triangulated the findings of the first two studies. Discrepancies and uncertainties between the studies were included in a reconciliation consensus study with a new group of experts (n = 25). The final results identified 92 definite behaviour change techniquemechanism of action links and 465 definite non-links. In a fourth study, we examined whether or not groups of behaviour change techniques used together frequently across interventions revealed shared theoretical underpinnings. We found that experts agreed on the underlying theory for three groups of behaviour change techniques.<h4>Results</h4>Our results are potentially useful to policy-makers and practitioners in selecting behaviour change techniques to include in behaviour change interventions. However, our data do not demonstrate that the behaviour change techniques are effective in targeting the mechanism of action; rather, the links identified may be the best bets for interventions that are effective in changing mechanisms of action, and the non-links are unlikely to be effective. Researchers examining effectiveness of interventions in either primary studies or evidence syntheses may consider these links for further investigation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>To make our results usable by researchers, practitioners and policy-makers, they are available in an online interactive tool, which enables discussion and collaboration (https://theoryandtechniquetool.humanbehaviourchange.org/); accessed 1 March 2020. This work, building on previous work to develop the behaviour change technique taxonomy, is part of an ongoing programme of work: the Human Behaviour Change Project (www.humanbehaviourchange.org/; accessed 1 March 2020).<h4>Funding</h4>This project was funded by the Medical Research Council via its Methodology Panel: Developing methodology for designing and evaluating theory-based complex interventions: an ontology for linking behaviour change techniques to theory (reference MR/L011115/1).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,iffy
33533177,Neuroblastoma: The basis for cure in limited-resource settings.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neuroblastoma (NB) contributes the most to the mortality of childhood malignancies worldwide. The disease spectrum is heterogenous and the management complex and costly, especially in advanced disease or disease with adverse biology. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the majority of NB presents in advanced stages. Therefore, with limited resources and poor prognosis the treatment of NB is often not a priority. The aim of the study was to evaluate the research activities and perceptions of the management of NB that determine the research and treatment approaches in LMICs.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were sourced from https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ identifying NB trials open to LMIC. Abstracts on NB research presented at the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) Congresses between 2014 and 2020 were evaluated according to income status. An online survey evaluating medical views on NB in LMICs and the effect on the management was conducted. Descriptive analysis was done. Where appropriate categorical association between covariates was assessed using the Pearson chi-square (<U+03C7><sup>2</sup> ) test or Fishers exact test.<h4>Results</h4>There were 15/562 (2.7%) trials open to LMIC. Only six of 138 (4.3%) LMIC participated in NB trials. Of the 688 abstracts presented between 2014 and 2020 at the SIOP International Congress on NB as primary subject, 297 (42.7%) were from LMICs. Only two were from low-income countries (LICs). Sixty-one countries responded to the NB survey. Positive views towards NB management were present when treatment was based on a national protocol, the availability of trimodal or advanced treatment options were present, and when a balance of metastatic or local disease were treated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Management of NB in LMICs should include increased advocacy and research as well as implementation of national management strategies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33544274,The Characterization of Sex Differences in Hypoglycemia-Induced Activation of HPA Axis on the Transcriptomic Level.,"Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis using an insulin tolerance test (ITT) is a medical diagnostic procedure that is frequently used in humans to assess the HPA and growth-hormone (GH) axes. Whether sex differences exist in the response to ITT stress is unknown. Thus, investigations into the analysis of transcripts during activation of the HPA axis in response to hypoglycemia have revealed the underlying influences of sex in signaling pathways that stimulate the HPA axis. We assessed four time points of ITT application in Balb/c mice. After insulin injection, expression levels of 192 microRNAs and 41 mRNAs associated with the HPA, GHand hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes were determined by real-time RT-PCR in the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal tissues, as well as blood samples (Raw data accession: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qI00NAtjxOepcNKxSJnQbJeBFa6zgHK?usp=sharing ). Although the ITT is commonly used as a gold standard for evaluating the HPA axis, we found completely different responses between males and females with respect to activation of the HPA axis. While activation of several transcripts in the hypothalamus and pituitary was observed after performing the ITT in males within 10min, females responded via the pituitary and adrenal immediately and durably over 40min. Additionally, we found that microRNA alterations precede mRNA responses in the HPA axis. Furthermore, robust changes in the levels of several transcripts including Avpr1b and Avpr2 observed at all time points strongly suggest that transcriptional control of these genes occurs mostly via differential signaling in pituitary and blood between males and females. Male and female HPA axis responses to ITT involve a number of sophisticated regulatory signaling pathways of miRNAs and mRNAs. Our results highlight the first robust markers in several layers of HPA, HPG and GH axis involved in ITT/hypoglycemia stress-induced dynamics.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

33587706,StructADMM: Achieving Ultrahigh Efficiency in Structured Pruning for DNNs.,"Weight pruning methods of deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to achieve a good model pruning rate without loss of accuracy, thereby alleviating the significant computation/storage requirements of large-scale DNNs. Structured weight pruning methods have been proposed to overcome the limitation of irregular network structure and demonstrated actual GPU acceleration. However, in prior work, the pruning rate (degree of sparsity) and GPU acceleration are limited (to less than 50%) when accuracy needs to be maintained. In this work, we overcome these limitations by proposing a unified, systematic framework of structured weight pruning for DNNs. It is a framework that can be used to induce different types of structured sparsity, such as filterwise, channelwise, and shapewise sparsity, as well as nonstructured sparsity. The proposed framework incorporates stochastic gradient descent (SGD; or ADAM) with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and can be understood as a dynamic regularization method in which the regularization target is analytically updated in each iteration. Leveraging special characteristics of ADMM, we further propose a progressive, multistep weight pruning framework and a network purification and unused path removal procedure, in order to achieve higher pruning rate without accuracy loss. Without loss of accuracy on the AlexNet model, we achieve 2.58x and 3.65x average measured speedup on two GPUs, clearly outperforming the prior work. The average speedups reach 3.15x and 8.52x when allowing a moderate accuracy loss of 2%. In this case, the model compression for convolutional layers is 15.0x, corresponding to 11.93x measured CPU speedup. As another example, for the ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 data set, we achieve an unprecedented 54.2x structured pruning rate on CONV layers. This is 32x higher pruning rate compared with recent work and can further translate into 7.6x inference time speedup on the Adreno 640 mobile GPU compared with the original, unpruned DNN model.

33621129,Associations between Blood Lead Levels and Coronary Artery Stenosis Measured Using Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lead exposure is a risk factor for increased blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, even when blood lead levels (BLLs) are within the normal range.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to investigate the association between BLL and coronary artery stenosis (CAS) in asymptomatic adults using 128-slice dual-source coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed medical records data from 2,193 adults (1,461 men and 732 women) who elected to complete a screening health examination, coronary CT angiography, and BLL measurement during 2011-2018 and had no history of CAS symptoms, cardiovascular disease, or occupational exposure to lead. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between moderate-to-severe CAS (=25% stenosis) and a 1-g/dL increase in blood lead, with and without adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, body mass index, regular exercise, smoking status, and alcohol drinking.<h4>Results</h4>BLLs ranged from 0.12 to 10.14g/dL, with an arithmetic mean of 2.711.26g/dL. The arithmetic mean was higher for men than for women (2.981.26g/dL vs. 2.181.08g/dL, p<0.001) and higher in the moderate-to-severe CAS group than in the no-CAS or <25% stenosis group (3.021.44g/dL vs. 2.671.23g/dL, p<0.001). Moderate-to-severe CAS was significantly associated with BLL before and after adjustment, with an adjusted odds ratio for a 1-g/dL increase in BLL of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.26), p=0.017.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BLL was positively associated with the prevalence of moderate-to-severe CAS in Korean adults who completed an elective screening examination for early cardiovascular disease, 94% of whom had a BLL of <5g/dL. More efforts and a strict health policy are needed to further reduce BLLs in the general population. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7351.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Outcomes assessed were human-milk energy (kcal/L), fat (g/L), and total protein (g/L) from mothers 1 to 6 mo postpartum. Studies with data on maternal BMI or weight and height that quantified human-milk energy, fat, or protein between 1 and 6 mo postpartum were eligible. Random-effects meta-regression weighted by the inverse of the study-level SE was completed for each of the 3 outcomes. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 11,373 titles and abstracts were identified, and after full-text screening, 69 articles of 66 studies were included. Meta-regression results showed a positive association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat (: 0.56 g/L; 95% CI: 0.034, 1.1; P = 0.04; I2 = 93.7%, n = 63 datapoints). There was no significant association between maternal BMI and human-milk energy (: 3.9 kcal/L; 95% CI: -1.6, 9.5; P = 0.16, I2 = 93.3%, n = 40 datapoints) or total protein (: 0.13 g/L; 95% CI: -0.16, 0.41; P = 0.37, I2 = 99.1%, n = 40 datapoints). The certainty of evidence for human-milk energy was low and the certainty of evidence for fat and total protein was very low.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Meta-regression analysis of available literature suggested an association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat between 1 and 6 mo postpartum. Future studies are needed to confirm the relation between maternal BMI; variation in human-milk energy, fat, and protein content; and the implications for child growth and development.

33693506,COVID-19: disease pathways and gene expression changes predict methylprednisolone can improve outcome in severe cases.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>COVID-19 has several distinct clinical phases: a viral replication phase, an inflammatory phase, and in some patients, a hyper-inflammatory phase. High mortality is associated with patients developing cytokine storm syndrome. Treatment of hyper-inflammation in these patients using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles could address the immediate need to reduce mortality.<h4>Results</h4>We analyzed the changes in the gene expression, pathways and putative mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV2 in NHBE, and A549 cells, as well as COVID-19 lung vs. their respective controls. We used these changes to identify FDA approved drugs that could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms related to hyper-inflammation. We identified methylprednisolone (MP) as a potential leading therapy. The results were then confirmed in five independent validation data sets including Vero E6 cells, lung and intestinal organoids, as well as additional patient lung sample vs. their respective controls. Finally, the efficacy of MP was validated in an independent clinical study. Thirty-day all-cause mortality occurred at a significantly lower rate in the MP-treated group compared to control group (29.6% vs. 16.6%, p = 0.027). Clinical results confirmed the in silico prediction that MP could improve outcomes in severe cases of COVID-19. A low number needed to treat (NNT = 5) suggests MP may be more efficacious than dexamethasone or hydrocortisone.<h4>Availability</h4>iPathwayGuide is available at https://ipathwayguide.advaitabio.com/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33720349,"Robust, flexible, and scalable tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium across diverse ancestries.","Traditional Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) tests (the <U+03C7>2 test and the exact test) have long been used as a metric for evaluating genotype quality, as technical artifacts leading to incorrect genotype calls often can be identified as deviations from HWE. However, in data sets composed of individuals from diverse ancestries, HWE can be violated even without genotyping error, complicating the use of HWE testing to assess genotype data quality. In this manuscript, we present the Robust Unified Test for HWE (RUTH) to test for HWE while accounting for population structure and genotype uncertainty, and to evaluate the impact of population heterogeneity and genotype uncertainty on the standard HWE tests and alternative methods using simulated and real sequence data sets. Our results demonstrate that ignoring population structure or genotype uncertainty in HWE tests can inflate false-positive rates by many orders of magnitude. Our evaluations demonstrate different tradeoffs between false positives and statistical power across the methods, with RUTH consistently among the best across all evaluations. RUTH is implemented as a practical and scalable software tool to rapidly perform HWE tests across millions of markers and hundreds of thousands of individuals while supporting standard VCF/BCF formats.

33725111,Whole genome analysis of more than 10 000 SARS-CoV-2 virus unveils global genetic diversity and target region of NSP6.,"Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is important to identify its genetic diversity. Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise. Finally, we have identified the potential conserved region as target that belongs to the coding region of ORF1ab, specifically to the NSP6 gene. Subsequently, we have provided the primers and probes using that conserved region so that it can be used for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

33751898,Rate of Communicative Gestures and Developmental Outcomes in Toddlers With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorder During a Home Observation.,"Purpose Most toddlers with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental delays receive early intervention at home and may not participate in a clinic-based communication evaluation. However, there is limited research that has prospectively examined communication in very young children with and without autism in a home-based setting. This study used granular observational coding to document the communicative acts performed by toddlers with autism, developmental delay, and typical development in the home environment. Method Children were selected from the archival database of the FIRST WORDS Project (<i>N</i> = 211). At approximately 20 months of age, each child participated in everyday activities with a caregiver during an hour-long, video-recorded, naturalistic home observation. Inventories of unique gestures, rates per minute, and proportions of types of communicative acts and communicative functions were coded and compared using a one-way analysis of variance. Concurrent and prospective relationships between rate of communication and measures of social communication, language development, and autism symptoms were examined. Results A total of 40,738 communicative acts were coded. Children with autism, developmental delay, and typical development used eight, nine, and 12 unique gestures on average, respectively. Children with autism used deictic gestures, vocalizations, and communicative acts for behavior regulation at significantly lower rates than the other groups. Statistically significant correlations were observed between rate of communication and several outcome measures. Conclusion Observation of social communication in the natural environment may improve early identification of children with autism and communication delays, complement clinic-based assessments, and provide useful information about a child's social communication profile and the family's preferred activities and intervention priorities.

However, the recurrence of thrombotic events, potential aspirin and clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness, and other limitations of DAPT have led to the development of newer oral anti-thrombotic drugs. Apixaban, a new non-vitamin K antagonist, has been approved for use. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the bleeding outcomes observed with the addition of apixaban to DAPT for the treatment of patients with ACS.<h4>Methods</h4>Online databases including EMBASE, Cochrane Central, http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched for English based publications comparing the use of apixaban added to DAPT for the treatment of patients with ACS. Different categories of bleeding events and cardiovascular outcomes were assessed. The analysis was carried out by the RevMan software version 5.4. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to represent the data following analysis.<h4>Results</h4>This research analysis consisted of 4 trials with a total number of 9010 participants. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) defined major bleeding (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.45-4.12; P = .0008), TIMI defined minor bleeding (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.71-5.70; P = .0002), International society of thrombosis and hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding (OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.80-3.45; P = .00001) and Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) defined severe bleeding (OR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.56-5.78; P = .01) were significantly increased with the addition of apixaban to DAPT versus DAPT alone in these patients with ACS. However fatal bleeding (OR: 10.96, 95% CI: 0.61-198.3; P = .11) was not significantly different.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Addition of the novel oral anticoagulant apixaban to the DAPT regimen significantly increased bleeding and therefore did not show any beneficial effect in these patients with ACS. However, due to the extremely limited data, we apparently have to rely on future larger studies to confirm this hypothesis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33765181,The hepatokine fetuin-A disrupts functional maturation of pancreatic beta cells.,"<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>Neonatal beta cells carry out a programme of postnatal functional maturation to achieve full glucose responsiveness. A partial loss of the mature phenotype of adult beta cells may contribute to a reduction of functional beta cell mass and accelerate the onset of type 2 diabetes. We previously found that fetuin-A, a hepatokine increasingly secreted by the fatty liver and a determinant of type 2 diabetes, inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) of human islets. Since fetuin-A is a ubiquitous fetal glycoprotein that declines peripartum, we examined here whether fetuin-A interferes with the functional maturity of beta cells.<h4>Methods</h4>The effects of fetuin-A were assessed during in vitro maturation of porcine neonatal islet cell clusters (NICCs) and in adult human islets. Expression alterations were examined via microarray, RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), proteins were analysed by western blotting and immunostaining, and insulin secretion was quantified in static incubations.<h4>Results</h4>NICC maturation was accompanied by the gain of glucose-responsive insulin secretion (twofold stimulation), backed up by mRNA upregulation of genes governing beta cell identity and function, such as NEUROD1, UCN3, ABCC8 and CASR (Log<sub>2</sub> fold change [Log<sub>2</sub>FC] > 1.6). An active TGF receptor (TGFBR)-SMAD2/3 pathway facilitates NICC maturation, since the TGFBR inhibitor SB431542 counteracted the upregulation of aforementioned genes and de-repressed ALDOB, a gene disallowed in mature beta cells. In fetuin-A-treated NICCs, upregulation of beta cell markers and the onset of glucose responsiveness were suppressed. Concomitantly, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation was inhibited. Transcriptome analysis confirmed inhibitory effects of fetuin-A and SB431542 on TGF-1- and SMAD2/3-regulated transcription. However, contrary to SB431542 and regardless of cMYC upregulation, fetuin-A inhibited beta cell proliferation (0.27  0.08% vs 1.0   0.1% Ki67-positive cells in control NICCs). This effect was sustained by reduced expression (Log<sub>2</sub>FC = -2.4) of FOXM1, CENPA, CDK1 or TOP2A. In agreement, the number of insulin-positive cells was lower in fetuin-A-treated NICCs than in control NICCs (14.4  1.2% and 22.3  1.1%, respectively). In adult human islets fetuin-A abolished glucose responsiveness, i.e. 1.7- and 1.1-fold change over 2.8mmol/l glucose in control- and fetuin-A-cultured islets, respectively. In addition, fetuin-A reduced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and suppressed expression of proliferative genes. Of note, in non-diabetic humans, plasma fetuin-A was negatively correlated (p = 0.013) with islet beta cell area.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our results suggest that the perinatal decline of fetuin-A relieves TGFBR signalling in islets, a process that facilitates functional maturation of neonatal beta cells. Functional maturity remains revocable in later life, and the occurrence of a metabolically unhealthy milieu, such as liver steatosis and elevated plasma fetuin-A, can impair both function and adaptive proliferation of beta cells.<h4>Data availability</h4>The RNAseq datasets and computer code produced in this study are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE144950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144950.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,data deposited as referenced
33768769,Prognostic factors in postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer - tertiary center experience.,"<h4>Background</h4>The aim of the study was to analyse the prognostic factors in postoperative prostate cancer irradiation and develop a nomogram for disease-free survival (DFS).<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This retrospective study included 236 consecutive prostate cancer patients who had radical prostatectomy followed by radiotherapy (RT) at a single tertiary institution between 2009 and 2014. The main outcome was DFS analysed through uni- and multivariable analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank testing, recursive partitioning analysis, and nomogram development.<h4>Results</h4>The median follow up was 62.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 38.1-79) months. The independent clinical factors associated with increased risk of recurrence or progression in the multivariate analysis (MVA) were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before RT, pT3 characteristic, and local failure as salvage indication. The value of PSA nadir had a significant impact on the risk of biochemical failure. Biochemical control and DFS were significantly different depending on treatment indication (p < 0.0001). The recursive partitioning analysis highlighted the importance of the PSA level before RT, Gleason Grade Group, PSA nadir, and local failure as a treatment indication. Finally, the nomogram for DFS was developed and is available online at https://apps.konsta.com.pl/app/prostate-salvage-dfs/.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Pre-RT PSA level, pT3 characteristic and local failure as salvage indication are pivotal prognostic factors associated with increased risk of recurrence or progression. The Gleason grade group of 4-5 and PSA nadir value allow for further risk stratification. The treatment outcomes in postoperative prostate cancer irradiation are significantly different depending on treatment indication. An online nomogram comprising of both pre-treatment and current data was developed allowing for visualization of changes in prognosis depending on clinical data.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33810805,Fast lightweight accurate xenograft sorting.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With an increasing number of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models being created and subsequently sequenced to study tumor heterogeneity and to guide therapy decisions, there is a similarly increasing need for methods to separate reads originating from the graft (human) tumor and reads originating from the host species' (mouse) surrounding tissue. Two kinds of methods are in use: On the one hand, alignment-based tools require that reads are mapped and aligned (by an external mapper/aligner) to the host and graft genomes separately first; the tool itself then processes the resulting alignments and quality metrics (typically BAM files) to assign each read or read pair. On the other hand, alignment-free tools work directly on the raw read data (typically FASTQ files). Recent studies compare different approaches and tools, with varying results.<h4>Results</h4>We show that alignment-free methods for xenograft sorting are superior concerning CPU time usage and equivalent in accuracy. We improve upon the state of the art sorting by presenting a fast lightweight approach based on three-way bucketed quotiented Cuckoo hashing. Our hash table requires memory comparable to an FM index typically used for read alignment and less than other alignment-free approaches. It allows extremely fast lookups and uses less CPU time than other alignment-free methods and alignment-based methods at similar accuracy. Several engineering steps (e.g., shortcuts for unsuccessful lookups, software prefetching) improve the performance even further.<h4>Availability</h4>Our software xengsort is available under the MIT license at http://gitlab.com/genomeinformatics/xengsort . It is written in numba-compiled Python and comes with sample Snakemake workflows for hash table construction and dataset processing.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

This paper describes the development of Citation.js (https://citation.js.org/), a tool to parse and format according to those standards. The program follows modern guidelines for software in general and JavaScript in specific, such as version control, source code analysis, integration testing and semantic versioning.<h4>Results</h4>The result is an extensible tool that has already seen adaption in a variety of sources and use cases: as part of a server-side page generator of a publishing platform, as part of a local extensible document generator, and as part of an in-browser converter of extracted references. Use cases range from transforming a list of DOIs or Wikidata identifiers into a BibTeX file on the command line, to displaying RIS references on a webpage with added Altmetric badges to generating """"How to cite this"""" sections on a blog. The accuracy of conversions is currently 27% for properties and 60% for types on average and a typical initialization takes 120 ms in browsers and 1 s with Node.js on the command line.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Citation.js is a library supporting various formats of bibliographic information in a broad selection of use cases and environments.

33832071,Genomic analysis of pancreatic cancer reveals 3 molecular subtypes with different clinical outcomes.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>Pancreatic cancer has a very high mortality with a 5-year survival of <5%. The purpose of this study was to classify specific molecular subtypes associated with prognosis of pancreatic cancer using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multiplatform genomic data.Multiplatform genomic data (N = 178), including gene expression, copy number alteration, and somatic mutation data, were obtained from cancer browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu, cohort: TCGA Pancreatic Cancer). Clinical data including survival results were analyzed. We also used validation cohort (GSE50827) to confirm the robustness of these molecular subtypes in pancreatic cancer.When we performed unsupervised clustering using TCGA gene expression data, we found three distinct molecular subtypes associated with different survival results. Copy number alteration and somatic mutation data showed different genomic patterns for these three subtypes. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that each subtype showed differentially altered pathways. Using each subtype-specific genes (200 were selected), we could predict molecular subtype in another cohort, confirming the robustness of these molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer. Cox regression analysis revealed that molecular subtype is the only significant prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer (P = .042, 95% confidence interval 0.523-0.98).Genomic analysis of pancreatic cancer revealed 3 distinct molecular subtypes associated with different survival results. Using these subtype-specific genes and prediction model, we could predict molecular subtype associated with prognosis of pancreatic cancer.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33851388,Acquired FXIII Deficiency is Associated with High Morbidity.,"<h4>Background</h4> A factor XIII (FXIII) level >30% is considered necessary to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Bleeding is also a risk in patients with acquired FXIII deficiency, but the hemostatic level of FXIII in this context remains to be determined.<h4>Methods</h4> We retrospectively analyzed all patients diagnosed with acquired FXIII deficiency at a large hospital over 3 years (study ID NCT04416594, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and assessed clinical data to identify the best cut-off point for FXIII activity to distinguish between low and high risk of major bleeding in a mixed medical and surgical population.<h4>Results</h4> Of the 97 patients who experienced bleeding despite a normal coagulation test, 43.2% had FXIII activity <70%. FXIII activity was significantly lower in surgical patients and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Low FXIII activity was significantly associated with long ICU stays and a high incidence of major bleeding.<h4>Conclusion</h4> Acquired FXIII deficiency is associated with high morbidity. The hemostatic level of FXIII in the setting of acquired FXIII deficiency might be above 30%.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33870774,The association between relationship strain and emotional well-being among older adult couples: the moderating role of social connectedness.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The present study examines the moderating role of social connectedness (i.e. closeness, talk frequency, social network size, and neighborhood social ties) in the association between one's own and spouse's relationship strain and emotional well-being (i.e. depressive symptoms, happiness, and loneliness).<h4>Method</h4>Married couples (<i>N</i> = 865) were drawn from the second wave of the National Social, Health, and Aging Project. One Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) and one Actor Partner Interdependence Model with Moderation (APIMoM) were conducted.<h4>Results</h4>In terms of actor effects, relationship strain was associated with all emotional well-being outcomes. Wives' and husbands' greater relationship strain was associated with spouses' loneliness. Only wives' greater relationship strain was associated with her husbands' higher level of depressive symptoms and no partner effects were found for happiness. In six instances, social connectedness factors helped to ameliorate the association between self/spouse relationship strain, depressive symptoms, and happiness. However, wives' greater neighborhood social ties amplified the association between wives greater relationship strain and husbands' greater depressive symptoms. We did not find that social connectedness factors moderated the associations between self/spouse relationship strain and loneliness.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Even in late life marriages, marital strain is associated with less happiness and greater depressive symptoms and loneliness. Practitioners addressing emotional well-being may need to pay attention to spousal perceptions of relationship strain and social relationships external to the marital relationship when working with heterosexual couples. Efforts throughout the life course should be made to ensure connections with diverse types of social networks.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1910786.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33900211,"Effect of Diameter and Number of Hepatocellular Carcinomas on Survival After Resection, Transarterial Chemoembolization, and Ablation.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Most studies predicting survival after resection, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and ablation analyzed diameter and number of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) as dichotomous variables, resulting in an underestimation of risk variation. We aimed to develop and validate a new prognostic model for patients with HCC using largest diameter and number of HCCs as continuous variables.<h4>Methods</h4>The prognostic model was developed using data from patients undergoing resection, TACE, and ablation in 645 Japanese institutions. The model results were shown after balanced using the inverse probability of treatment-weighted analysis and were externally validated in an international multi-institution cohort.<h4>Results</h4>Of 77,268 patients, 43,904 patients, including 15,313 (34.9%) undergoing liver resection, 13,375 (30.5%) undergoing TACE, and 15,216 (34.7%) undergoing ablation, met the inclusion criteria. Our model (http://www.u-tokyo-hbp-transplant-surgery.jp/about/calculation.html) showed that the 5-year overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC undergoing these procedures decreased with progressive incremental increases in diameter and number of HCCs. For patients undergoing resection, the inverse probability of treatment-weighted-adjusted 5-year OS probabilities were 10%-20% higher compared with patients undergoing TACE for 1-6 HCC lesions <10 cm and were also 10%-20% higher compared with patients undergoing ablation when the HCC diameter was 2-3 cm. For patients undergoing resection and TACE, the model performed well in the external cohort.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our novel prognostic model performed well in predicting OS after resection and TACE for HCC and demonstrated that resection may have a survival benefit over TACE and ablation based on the diameter and number of HCCs.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33902704,The impact of sequencing depth on the inferred taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of metagenomic samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. There are many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. In this study we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the same samples to address these issues. We sampled three potential environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth (~ 200 million reads per sample). Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing (short- and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to the metagenomic data. To automate data processing, we developed an open-source software pipeline, 'ResPipe'.<h4>Results</h4>Taxonomic profiling was much more stable to sequencing depth than AMR gene content. 1 million reads per sample was sufficient to achieve < 1% dissimilarity to the full taxonomic composition. However, at least 80 million reads per sample were required to recover the full richness of different AMR gene families present in the sample, and additional allelic diversity of AMR genes was still being discovered in effluent at 200 million reads per sample. Normalising the number of reads mapping to AMR genes using gene length and an exogenous spike of Thermus thermophilus DNA substantially changed the estimated gene abundance distributions. While the majority of genomic content from cultured isolates from effluent was recoverable using shotgun metagenomics, this was not the case for pig caeca or river sediment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sequencing depth and profiling method can critically affect the profiling of polymicrobial animal and environmental samples with shotgun metagenomics. Both sequencing of cultured isolates and shotgun metagenomics can recover substantial diversity that is not identified using the other methods. Particular consideration is required when inferring AMR gene content or presence by mapping metagenomic reads to a database.

33951459,Hotspot identifies informative gene modules across modalities of single-cell genomics.,"Two fundamental aims that emerge when analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data are identifying which genes vary in an informative manner and determining how these genes organize into modules. Here, we propose a general approach to these problems, called """"Hotspot,"""" that operates directly on a given metric of cell-cell similarity, allowing for its integration with any method (linear or non-linear) for identifying the primary axes of transcriptional variation between cells. In addition, we show that when using multimodal data, Hotspot can be used to identify genes whose expression reflects alternative notions of similarity between cells, such as physical proximity in a tissue or clonal relatedness in a cell lineage tree. In this manner, we demonstrate that while Hotspot is capable of identifying genes that reflect nuanced transcriptional variability between T helper cells, it can also identify spatially dependent patterns of gene expression in the cerebellum as well as developmentally heritable expression programs during embryogenesis. Hotspot is implemented as an open-source Python package and is available for use at http://www.github.com/yoseflab/hotspot.

33968128,The Molecular Functions of MeCP2 in Rett Syndrome Pathology.,"MeCP2 protein, encoded by the <i>MECP2</i> gene, binds to DNA and affects transcription. Outside of this activity the true range of MeCP2 function is still not entirely clear. As <i>MECP2</i> gene mutations cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome in 1 in 10,000 female births, much of what is known about the biologic function of MeCP2 comes from studying human cell culture models and rodent models with <i>Mecp2</i> gene mutations. In this review, the full scope of MeCP2 research available in the NIH Pubmed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) data base to date is considered. While not all original research can be mentioned due to space limitations, the main aspects of MeCP2 and Rett syndrome research are discussed while highlighting the work of individual researchers and research groups. First, the primary functions of MeCP2 relevant to Rett syndrome are summarized and explored. Second, the conflicting evidence and controversies surrounding emerging aspects of MeCP2 biology are examined. Next, the most obvious gaps in MeCP2 research studies are noted. Finally, the most recent discoveries in MeCP2 and Rett syndrome research are explored with a focus on the potential and pitfalls of novel treatments and therapies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
33976872,Analysis of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> processing under salt stress in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> spore outgrowth using RNA sequencing data.,"<b>Background:</b> In spore-forming bacteria, the molecular mechanisms of accumulation of transfer RNA (tRNA) during sporulation must be a priority as tRNAs play an essential role in protein synthesis during spore germination and outgrowth. However, tRNA processing has not been extensively studied in these conditions, and knowledge of these mechanisms is important to understand long-term stress survival. <b>Methods:</b>To gain further insight into tRNA processing during spore germination and outgrowth, the expression of the single copy tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> gene was analyzed in the presence and absence of 1.2 M NaCl in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> using RNA-Seq data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The CLC Genomics work bench 12.0.2 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) was used to analyze reads from the tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> gene. <b>Results:</b>The results show that spores store different populations of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup>-related molecules. One such population, representing 60% of total tRNA <sup>Cys</sup>, was composed of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> fragments. Half of these fragments (3-tRF) possessed CC, CCA or incorrect additions at the 3end. tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> with correct CCA addition at the 3end represented 23% of total tRNA <sup>Cys</sup>, while with CC addition represented 9% of the total and with incorrect addition represented 7%. While an accumulation of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> precursors was induced by upregulation of the <i>rrnD</i> operon under the control of s <sup>A</sup> -dependent promoters under both conditions investigated, salt stress produced only a modest effect on tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> expression and the accumulation of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> related species. <b>Conclusions</b>:The results demonstrate that tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> molecules resident in spores undergo dynamic processing to produce functional molecules that may play an essential role during protein synthesis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource
33983910,"Surveillance of Vaccination Coverage Among Adult Populations -United States, 2018.","<h4>Problem/condition</h4>Adults are at risk for illness, hospitalization, disability and, in some cases, death from vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly influenza and pneumococcal disease. CDC recommends vaccinations for adults on the basis of age, health conditions, prior vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccination recommendations from CDC are published annually in the U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule. Despite longstanding recommendations for use of many vaccines, vaccination coverage among U.S. adults remains low.<h4>Reporting period</h4>August 2017-June 2018 (for influenza vaccination) and January-December 2018 (for pneumococcal, herpes zoster, tetanus and diphtheria [Td]/tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis [Tdap], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccination).<h4>Description of system</h4>The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous, cross-sectional national household survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. NHIS's objective is to monitor the health of the U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors. Adult receipt of influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, Td/Tdap, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and at least 1 dose of HPV vaccines was assessed. Estimates were derived for a new composite adult vaccination quality measure and by selected demographic and access-to-care characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, indication for vaccination, travel history [travel to countries where hepatitis infections are endemic], health insurance status, contacts with physicians, nativity, and citizenship). Trends in adult vaccination were assessed during 2010-2018.<h4>Results</h4>Coverage for the adult age-appropriate composite measure was low in all age groups. Racial and ethnic differences in coverage persisted for all vaccinations, with lower coverage for most vaccinations among non-White compared with non-Hispanic White adults. Linear trend tests indicated coverage increased from 2010 to 2018 for most vaccines in this report. Few adults aged =19 years had received all age-appropriate vaccines, including influenza vaccination, regardless of whether inclusion of Tdap (13.5%) or inclusion of any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine (20.2%) receipt was measured. Coverage among adults for influenza vaccination during the 2017-18 season (46.1%) was similar to the estimate for the 2016-17 season (45.4%), and coverage for pneumococcal (adults aged =65 years [69.0%]), herpes zoster (adults aged =50 years and aged =60 years [24.1% and 34.5%, respectively]), tetanus (adults aged =19 years [62.9%]), Tdap (adults aged =19 years [31.2%]), hepatitis A (adults aged =19 years [11.9%]), and HPV (females aged 19-26 years [52.8%]) vaccination in 2018 were similar to the estimates for 2017. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults aged =19 years and health care personnel (HCP) aged =19 years increased 4.2 and 6.7 percentage points to 30.0% and 67.2%, respectively, from 2017. HPV vaccination coverage among males aged 19-26 years increased 5.2 percentage points to 26.3% from the 2017 estimate. Overall, HPV vaccination coverage among females aged 19-26 years did not increase, but coverage among Hispanic females aged 19-26 years increased 10.8 percentage points to 49.6% from the 2017 estimate. Coverage for the following vaccines was lower among adults without health insurance compared with those with health insurance: influenza vaccine (among adults aged =19 years, 19-49 years, and 50-64 years), pneumococcal vaccine (among adults aged 19-64 years at increased risk), Td vaccine (among all age groups), Tdap vaccine (among adults aged =19 years and 19-64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (among adults aged =19 years overall and among travelers aged =19 years), hepatitis B vaccine (among adults aged =19 years and 19-49 years and among travelers aged =19 years), herpes zoster vaccine (among adults aged =60 years), and HPV vaccine (among males and females aged 19-26 years). Adults who reported having a usual place for health care generally reported receipt of recommended vaccinations more often than those who did not have such a place, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was higher among adults reporting =1 physician contact during the preceding year compared with those who had not visited a physician during the preceding year, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and =10 physician contacts during the preceding year, depending on the vaccine, 20.1%-87.5% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with specific indications. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born adults was significantly higher than that of foreign-born adults, including influenza vaccination (aged =19 years), pneumococcal vaccination (all ages), tetanus vaccination (all ages), Tdap vaccination (all ages), hepatitis B vaccination (aged =19 years and 19-49 years and travelers aged =19 years), herpes zoster vaccination (all ages), and HPV vaccination among females aged 19-26 years. Vaccination coverage also varied by citizenship status and years living in the United States.<h4>Interpretation</h4>NHIS data indicate that many adults remain unprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases. Coverage for the adult age-appropriate composite measures was low in all age groups. Individual adult vaccination coverage remained low as well, but modest gains occurred in vaccination coverage for hepatitis B (among adults aged =19 years and HCP aged =19 years), and HPV (among males aged 19-26 years and Hispanic females aged 19-26 years). Coverage for other vaccines and groups with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices vaccination indications did not improve from 2017. Although HPV vaccination coverage among males aged 19-26 years and Hispanic females aged 19-26 years increased, approximately 50% of females aged 19-26 years and 70% of males aged 19-26 years remained unvaccinated. Racial/ethnic vaccination differences persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. Having health insurance coverage, having a usual place for health care, and having =1 physician contacts during the preceding 12 months were associated with higher vaccination coverage; however, these factors alone were not associated with optimal adult vaccination coverage, and findings indicate missed opportunities to vaccinate remained.<h4>Public health actions</h4>Substantial improvement in adult vaccination uptake is needed to reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases. Following the Standards for Adult Immunization Practice (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/adults/for-practice/standards/index.html), all providers should routinely assess adults' vaccination status at every clinical encounter, strongly recommend appropriate vaccines, either offer needed vaccines or refer their patients to another provider who can administer the needed vaccines, and document vaccinations received by their patients in an immunization information system.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34003431,The C-BIG Repository: an Institution-Level Open Science Platform.,"In January 2016, the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital (The Neuro) declared itself an Open Science organization. This vision extends beyond efforts by individual scientists seeking to release individual datasets, software tools, or building platforms that provide for the free dissemination of such information. It involves multiple stakeholders and an infrastructure that considers governance, ethics, computational resourcing, physical design, workflows, training, education, and intra-institutional reporting structures. The C-BIG repository was built in response as The Neuro's institutional biospecimen and clinical data repository, and collects biospecimens as well as clinical, imaging, and genetic data from patients with neurological disease and healthy controls. It is aimed at helping scientific investigators, in both academia and industry, advance our understanding of neurological diseases and accelerate the development of treatments. As many neurological diseases are quite rare, they present several challenges to researchers due to their small patient populations. Overcoming these challenges required the aggregation of datasets from various projects and locations. The C-BIG repository achieves this goal and stands as a scalable working model for institutions to collect, track, curate, archive, and disseminate multimodal data from patients. In November 2020, a Registered Access layer was made available to the wider research community at https://cbigr-open.loris.ca , and in May2021 fully open data will be released to complement the Registered Access data. This article outlines many of the aspects of The Neuro's transition to Open Science by describing the data to be released, C-BIG's full capabilities, and the design aspects that were implemented for effective data sharing.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,scope
34007002,Severity modeling of propionic acidemia using clinical and laboratory biomarkers.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To conduct a proof-of-principle study to identify subtypes of propionic acidemia (PA) and associated biomarkers.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from a clinically diverse PA patient population ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02890342 ) were used to train and test machine learning models, identify PA-relevant biomarkers, and perform validation analysis using data from liver-transplanted participants. k-Means clustering was used to test for the existence of PA subtypes. Expert knowledge was used to define PA subtypes (mild and severe). Given expert classification, supervised machine learning (support vector machine with a polynomial kernel, svmPoly) performed dimensional reduction to define relevant features of each PA subtype.<h4>Results</h4>Forty participants enrolled in the study; five underwent liver transplant. Analysis with k-means clustering indicated that several PA subtypes may exist on the biochemical continuum. The conventional PA biomarkers, plasma total 2-methylctirate and propionylcarnitine, were not statistically significantly different between nontransplanted and transplanted participants motivating us to search for other biomarkers. Unbiased dimensional reduction using svmPoly revealed that plasma transthyretin, alanine:serine ratio, GDF15, FGF21, and in vivo 1-<sup>13</sup>C-propionate oxidation, play roles in defining PA subtypes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Support vector machine prioritized biomarkers that helped classify propionic acidemia patients according to severity subtypes, with important ramifications for future clinical trials and management of PA.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34013078,Host pharmacogenetic factors that may affect liver neoplasm incidence upon using direct-acting antivirals for treating hepatitis C infection.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represent a breakthrough in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment as they directly inhibit HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B). However, ongoing debates exist regarding their relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose incidence is widely debated among investigators. This study was conducted to identify host pharmacogenetic factors that may influence HCC incidence upon using HCV DAAs.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Details regarding 16 HCV DAAs were collected from literature and DrugBank database. Digital structures of these drugs were fed into the pharmacogenomics/pharmacovigilance <i>in</i> <i>-</i> <i>silico</i> pipeline (PHARMIP) to predict the genetic factors that may underpin HCC development.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 184 unique genes and 40 unique variants that may have key answers for the DAA/HCC paradox. These findings could be used in different methods to aid in the precise application of HCV DAAs and minimize the proposed risk for HCC. All results could be accessed at: https://doi.org/10.17632/8ws8258hn3.2.<h4>Discussion</h4>All the identified factors are evidence related to HCC and significantly predicted by PHARMIP as DAA targets. We discuss some examples of the methods of using these results to address the DAA/HCC controversy based on the following three primary levels: 1 - individual DAA drug, 2 - DAA subclass, and 3 - the entire DAA class. Further wet laboratory investigation is required to evaluate these results.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,mendely
34019771,Practice Mediates Bidirectional Dual-Task Interference When Performing a Novel Sequential Nonword Repetition Task.,"Introduction The current study examined the extent to which practice amount mediates dual-task interference patterns associated with concurrent performance of a novel speech task and attention-demanding visuomotor task. Method A Sequential Nonword Repetition Task was used to examine the effect of practice on interference associated with concurrent performance of a Visuomotor Pursuit Task. Twenty-five young adult participants were assigned to either an Extended Practice Group or a Limited Practice Group and performed a novel Sequential Nonword Repetition Task in isolation and while performing a concurrent visuomotor pursuit rotor task. Results Participants in the Limited Practice Group who were afforded a limited amount of practice exhibited dual-task interference (i.e., dual-task performance reductions) for both the speech and visuomotor tasks (i.e., bidirectional dual-task interference). Conversely, participants in the Extended Practice Group who were afforded extended practice exhibited little-to-no observable dual-task interference on the nonword repetition task. Conclusion Data from the current investigation suggest that the amount of initial practice mediates the degree of dual-task interference observed when a novel speech production task is performed with an attention-demanding Visuomotor Pursuit Task.

34019885,Interventions to decrease complications after shoulder dystocia: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes associated with the implementation of simulation exercises to reduce the sequela of shoulder dystocia.<h4>Data sources</h4>Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature database, and Scopus) were initially queried in June 2020 and updated in November 2020. The following 3 concepts were introduced and refined using the controlled vocabulary of the database: vaginal birth, shoulder dystocia, and simulation training. There were no limitations to the year of publication as part of the search strategy.<h4>Study eligibility criteria</h4>We included all studies that reported on the frequency of shoulder dystocia and the associated complications before and after the implementation of interventional exercises to improve outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Two authors independently assessed the abstracts and full-text articles of all studies for eligibility and evaluated the quality of the included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Any inconsistencies related to study evaluation or data extraction were resolved by a third author. The coprimary outcomes of this systematic review and meta-analysis were neonatal brachial plexus palsy diagnosed following deliveries complicated by shoulder dystocia and persistence of brachial palsy at 12 months or later. The secondary outcomes were the frequency of shoulder dystocia and cesarean delivery. Study effects were combined using a Bayesian meta-analysis and were reported as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals (Crs).<h4>Results</h4>Of the 372 articles reviewed, 16 publications, which included 428,552 deliveries with 217,713 (50.8%) deliveries during the preintervention and 210,839 (49.2%) deliveries during the postinterventional period, were included in the meta-analysis. The incidence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy after shoulder dystocia decreased from 12.1% to 5.7% (risk ratio, 0.37; 95% Cr, 0.26-0.57; probability of reduction 100%). The overall proportion of neonatal brachial plexus palsy decreased, but with less precision, from 0.3% to 0.1% (risk ratio, 0.53; 95% Cr, 0.21-1.26; probability of reduction 94%). Two studies followed newborns with brachial plexus palsy for at least 12 months. One study that reported on persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy at 12 months among 1148 shoulder dystocia cases noted a reduction in persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy from 1.9% to 0.2% of shoulder dystocia cases (risk ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.49). In contrast, the study that reported on persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy at 12 months for all deliveries noted that it did not change significantly, namely from 0.3 to 0.2 per 1000 births (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.90). Following the implementation of shoulder dystocia interventional exercises, the diagnosis of shoulder dystocia increased significantly from 1.2% to 1.7% of vaginal deliveries (risk ratio, 1.39; 95% Cr, 1.19-1.65; probability of increase 100%). Compared with the preimplementation period, the cesarean delivery rate increased postimplementation from 21.2% to 25.9% (risk ratio, 1.22; 95% Cr, 0.93-1.59; probability of increase 93%). We created an online tool (https://ccrebm-bell.shinyapps.io/sdmeta/) that permits calculation of the absolute risk reduction and absolute risk increase attributable to the intervention vis--vis the incidence of shoulder dystocia, neonatal brachial plexus palsy, and cesarean deliveries.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Introduction of shoulder dystocia interventional exercises decreased the rate of neonatal brachial plexus palsy per shoulder dystocia case; the data on persistence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy beyond 12 months is limited and contradictory. Implementation of the interventions was associated with an increase in the diagnosis of shoulder dystocia and rate of cesarean deliveries.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,calcualtion tool
34030448,Genomic Approaches to Plant-Pathogen Epidemiology and Diagnostics.,"Diseases have a significant cost to agriculture. Findings from analyses of whole-genome sequences show great promise for informing strategies to mitigate risks from diseases caused by phytopathogens. Genomic approaches can be used to dramatically shorten response times to outbreaks and inform disease management in novel ways. However, the use of these approaches requires expertise in working with big, complex data sets and an understanding of their pitfalls and limitations to infer well-supported conclusions. We suggest using an evolutionary framework to guide the use of genomic approaches in epidemiology and diagnostics of plant pathogens. We also describe steps that are necessary for realizing these as standard approaches in disease surveillance.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,how did this get in??
34036443,"BDD Knowledge, Attitude and Practice Among Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Worldwide.","<h4>Background</h4>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a controversial topic in the field of plastic surgery.<h4>Objective</h4>Our aim was to determine whether BDD knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) are affected by the experience of the surgeon in the field, sex of the surgeon, country of practice, and the number of patients the surgeon sees annually. We were particularly interested in uncovering any significant relations in KAP of BDD between plastic surgeons practicing in developed versus developing countries.<h4>Methods</h4>We created a two-page survey of 24 questions about the KAP of BDD. The survey was sent to aesthetic plastic surgeons worldwide via ISAPS global email list. The data were collected over a period of 20 days at the end of 2020.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 464 plastic surgeons completed the survey. The only factor that determines the awareness of BDD is the experience of the surgeon. The more experienced the surgeon is, the more likely he/she is to be familiar with the clinical picture of BDD. Although aware, the more experienced surgeons tend to dismiss the importance of referring BDD patients to psychiatrists/psychologists. Male surgeons tend to diagnose more patients with BDD than female surgeons. Surgeons who estimated the correct prevalence of BDD among patients seeking surgery acquired knowledge of BDD from scientific journals. The KAP is relatively similar between surgeons practicing in developed and developing countries, and the main statistically significant difference was in the questions used during the course of the interviews to diagnose BDD.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We can deduce from the results that most aesthetic surgeons worldwide have got knowledge of the presentation of BDD and are keen to diagnose the disorder in their practice. It is worth noting that surgeons usually have their unique approach in the management of BDD. Our study highlights the importance of not only raising awareness of the best management of BDD, but also of establishing a consensus that BDD is a contraindication to aesthetic treatment. The best methods to raise awareness are through journals and plastic surgery residency.<h4>Level of evidence v</h4>This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

34043002,Identification of evolutionarily stable functional and immunogenic sites across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and greater coronavirus family.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Since the first recognized case of COVID-19, more than 100 million people have been infected worldwide. Global efforts in drug and vaccine development to fight the disease have yielded vaccines and drug candidates to cure COVID-19. However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens the continued efficacy of these treatments. In order to address this, we interrogate the evolutionary history of the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome to identify evolutionarily conserved functional sites that can inform the search for treatments with broader coverage across the coronavirus family.<h4>Results</h4>Combining coronavirus family sequence information with the mutations observed in the current COVID-19 outbreak, we systematically and comprehensively define evolutionarily stable sites that may provide useful drug and vaccine targets and which are less likely to be compromised by the emergence of new virus strains. Several experimentally-validated effective drugs interact with these proposed target sites. In addition, the same evolutionary information can prioritize cross reactive antigens that are useful in directing multi-epitope vaccine strategies to illicit broadly neutralizing immune responses to the betacoronavirus family. Although the results are focused on SARS-CoV-2, these approaches stem from evolutionary principles that are agnostic to the organism or infective agent.<h4>Availability</h4>The results of this work are made interactively available at http://cov.lichtargelab.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

34123499,ML-SIM: universal reconstruction of structured illumination microscopy images using transfer learning.,"Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has become an important technique for optical super-resolution imaging because it allows a doubling of image resolution at speeds compatible with live-cell imaging. However, the reconstruction of SIM images is often slow, prone to artefacts, and requires multiple parameter adjustments to reflect different hardware or experimental conditions. Here, we introduce a versatile reconstruction method, ML-SIM, which makes use of transfer learning to obtain a parameter-free model that generalises beyond the task of reconstructing data recorded by a specific imaging system for a specific sample type. We demonstrate the generality of the model and the high quality of the obtained reconstructions by application of ML-SIM on raw data obtained for multiple sample types acquired on distinct SIM microscopes. ML-SIM is an end-to-end deep residual neural network that is trained on an auxiliary domain consisting of simulated images, but is transferable to the target task of reconstructing experimental SIM images. By generating the training data to reflect challenging imaging conditions encountered in real systems, ML-SIM becomes robust to noise and irregularities in the illumination patterns of the raw SIM input frames. Since ML-SIM does not require the acquisition of experimental training data, the method can be efficiently adapted to any specific experimental SIM implementation. We compare the reconstruction quality enabled by ML-SIM with current state-of-the-art SIM reconstruction methods and demonstrate advantages in terms of generality and robustness to noise for both simulated and experimental inputs, thus making ML-SIM a useful alternative to traditional methods for challenging imaging conditions. Additionally, reconstruction of a SIM stack is accomplished in less than 200 ms on a modern graphics processing unit, enabling future applications for real-time imaging. Source code and ready-to-use software for the method are available at http://ML-SIM.github.io.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34135895,Transcriptomic Signature Differences Between SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Virus Infected Patients.,"The reason why most individuals with COVID-19 have relatively limited symptoms while other develop respiratory distress with life-threatening complications remains unknown. Increasing evidence suggests that COVID-19 associated adverse outcomes mainly rely on dysregulated immunity.Here, we compared transcriptomic profiles of blood cells from 103 patients with different severity levels of COVID-19 with that of 27 healthy and 22 influenza-infected individuals. Data provided a complete overview of SARS-CoV-2-induced immune signature, including a dramatic defect in IFN responses, a reduction of toxicity-related molecules in NK cells, an increased degranulation of neutrophils, a dysregulation of T cells, a dramatic increase in B cell function and immunoglobulin production, as well as an important over-expression of genes involved in metabolism and cell cycle in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to those infected with influenza viruses. These features also differed according to COVID-19 severity. Overall and specific gene expression patterns across groups can be visualized on an interactive website (https://bix.unil.ch/covid/). Collectively, these transcriptomic host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed in the context of current studies, thereby improving our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and shaping the severity level of COVID-19.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,iffy - clinical but gene; seems to be viz only

34186186,"In silico modelling of acute toxicity of 1, 2, 4-triazole antifungal agents towards zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos: Application of the Small Dataset Modeller tool.","Nowadays, there is a widespread use of triazole antifungal agents to kill broad classes of fungi in farming lands and to protect herbs, fruits and grains. These agents further deposit into the aquatic systems causing toxicity to the living aquatic creatures, which can then affect human beings. Considering this issue, risk assessment of these toxic chemicals is a very essential task. Due to the inadequate experimental data on acute toxicity of antifungal agents containing the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring, higher testing costs along with the regulatory restrictions and the international regulations to lessen animal testing emphasize on in silico techniques such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. The application of QSAR modelling has created an easier avenue to predict activity/property/toxicity of newly synthesized compounds. In the present study, we have used 23 antifungal agents containing the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring to develop 2D-QSAR models and explored their structural attributes crucial for acute toxicity towards embryonic phase of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Here, we have employed simple 2D descriptors to develop the QSAR models. The models were evolved by executing the Small Dataset Modeller tool (https://dtclab.webs.com/software-tools), and the validation of the models was achieved by employing different precise validation principles. The statistical validation metrics confirm that built models are robust, useful and well predictive to forecast the acute toxicity of new compounds.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

As the number of experimentally verified bioactive peptides has increased significantly, various of in silico approaches are imperative for investigating the characteristics of ACPs. However, the lack of methods for investigating the differences in physicochemical properties of ACPs. In this study, we compared the N- and C-terminal amino acid composition for each peptide, there are three major subtypes of ACPs that are defined based on the distribution of positively charged residues. For the first time, we were motivated to develop a two-step machine learning model for identification of the subtypes of ACPs, which classify the input data into the corresponding group before applying the classifier. Further, to improve the predictive power, the hybrid feature sets were considered for prediction. Evaluation by five-fold cross-validation showed that the two-step model trained with sequence-based features and physicochemical properties was most effective in discriminating between ACPs and non-ACPs. The two-step model trained with the hybrid features performed well, with a sensitivity of 86.75%, a specificity of 85.75%, an accuracy of 86.08%, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient value of 0.703. Furthermore, the model also consistently provides the effective performance in independent testing set, with sensitivity of 77.6%, specificity of 94.74%, accuracy of 88.99% and the MCC value reached 0.75.

34210950,Exploration of the Important Role of Microfibril-Associated Protein 4 Gene in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common tumor of the head and neck. Its treatment usually requires multiple modalities. Currently, there are no molecular biomarkers to guide these treatment strategies. Studies have shown that microfibril-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is potentially useful for non-invasive assessment of various diseases; however, its biological function in tumors is still unknown. In this study, we propose that MFAP4 is a new prognostic target for OSCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS First, we collected OSCC data (GSE25099 and GSE30784 datasets) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and compared the differential expression of MFAP4 gene between the patients (tumor) and normal (control) groups. The comparison was done with University of California Santa Cruz Xena (https://xenabrowser.net/Datapages/), and we calculated the difference in MFAP4 gene expression between normal and tumor tissues in a pan-cancer analysis. Then, we compared the 2 groups with high and low expression of MFAP4 gene in terms of tumor mutation burden (TMB), miRNA regulation, and immune cell infiltration. RESULTS We found that the expression of MFAP4 gene was significantly decreased in tumors. Our research also showed that high expression of MFAP4 was related to better prognosis of patients and may be related to tumor gene mutation, miRNA regulation, and infiltration of different immune cells. CONCLUSIONS Our work provides evidence that expression of MFAP4 can be used as a prognostic biomarker for risk stratification of OSCC patients and elaborates on its relation with the regulation of TMB, miRNAs, and immune cell infiltration.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource

Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was employed to sift variables; subsequently, Cox proportional hazards regression model was built. We applied the enhanced bootstrap validation to appraise the discrimination and calibration of the model. Clinical benefit was measured using decision curve analysis (DCA). Thereafter, a web-based calculator based on the model, which could be used to predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates, was developed.<h4>Results</h4>Race, age, histologic type, grade, N stage, and therapeutic methods were selected. C-indices of the prediction model in the training and validation groups were 0.726 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.679-0.773) and 0.724 (95% CI, 0.679-0.769), respectively. Calibration curves showed good agreement between the groups. The DCA demonstrated that the prediction model is clinically useful.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prediction model we developed showed a good performance in calculating the OS rates in patients with Stage I EC.

However, published data is often inconsistent resulting from different methods that are not precisely described in most studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied a well-proven enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure calcitonin gene-related peptide concentrations in human blood plasma, we modified parameters of plasma preparation and protein purification and used calcitonin gene-related peptide-free plasma for standard solutions, which are described in detail.<h4>Results</h4>Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels are stable in plasma with peptidase inhibitors and after deep-freezing. Calcitonin gene-related peptide standard solutions based on synthetic intercellular fluid or pooled plasma with pre-absorbed calcitonin gene-related peptide influenced the measurements but yielded both comprehensible results. In a sample of 56 healthy subjects the calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels varied considerably from low (<50 pg/mL) to very high (>500 pg/mL) values. After a 12-hour exposure of these subjects to normobaric hypoxia the individual calcitonin gene-related peptide levels remained stable.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Buffering with peptidase inhibitors and immediate freezing or processing of plasma samples is essential to achieve reliable measurements. Individuals show considerable differences and partly high calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels without detectable pathological reason. Thus plasma measurements are suited particularly to follow calcitonin gene-related peptide levels in longitudinal studies.The use of data for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the MedicalUniversity of Innsbruck (https://www.i-med.ac.at/ethikkommission/; EK Nr: 1242/2017).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

The GL content in maca, which is recognized as a """"superfood"""", is approximately 100-times higher than that in other brassicas. Although maca is a potential dietary source of GLs, limited studies have examined the bioactivity of maca GLs using the combination of chemical characterization and bioassays. In this study, the fractions (Lm-II and Lm-III) rich in intact GLs (glucotropaeolin and glucolimnanthin) were isolated and characterized from maca ethanolic extracts using chromatography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, the growth-inhibitory effects of Lm-II and Lm-II fractions against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2/C3A) and colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) cell lines were examined in the absence or presence of myrosinase (MYR). Fractions lacking low molecular weight sugars dose-dependently exerted cytotoxic effects in the presence of MYR. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of Lm-II and Lm-III against HepG2/C3A were 118.8 and 69.9 g/mL, respectively, while those against HT29 were 102.6 and 71.5 g/mL, respectively. These results suggest that the anticancer properties of maca can be attributed to GLs and corroborate the categorization of maca as a """"superfood.""""Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.1952444.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34296017,Individual and community-level determinants of Iron-Folic Acid Intake for the recommended period among pregnant women in Ethiopia: A multilevel analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Iron-folic acid (IFA) intake for the recommended period during pregnancy reduces the risk of anemia and congenital anomalies. However, IFA intake for the recommended period is still very low in low-income countries including Ethiopia. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess both individual-and community-level determinants of IFA intake for the recommended period among pregnant women in Ethiopia.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were retrieved from the Demographic and Health Survey program's official database website (http://dhsprogram.com). A two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique was employed to conduct the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. A sample of 3088 pregnant women who had received at least one dose of IFA in Ethiopia were included in this study. A multivariable multilevel logistic regression analysis model was fitted to identify the determinants of IFA intake below the recommended period [< 90 days] during pregnancy. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was used during the model selection procedure.<h4>Results</h4>This study revealed that 87.6% [95% CI; 86.3%, 88.6%] of the women took IFA below the recommended period during the index pregnancy. After adjusting for the covariates: living in rural areas [AOR = 1.74: 95% CI 1.37, 2.50], and women's illiterate proportion [AOR = 1.43: 95% CI 1.06, 1.70] were community level factors. Whereas, primary education level [AOR = 0.63: 95% CI 0.40, 0.78], poorer wealth index [AOR = 1.53: 95% CI 1.08, 3.09], 4 + antenatal care visits [AOR = 0.43: 95% CI 0.31, 0.69], and receive nutritional counseling during pregnancy [AOR = 0.63: 95% CI 0.37, 0.84] were the individual-level factors of IFA intake below the recommended period during pregnancy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, nearly nine out of ten pregnant women did not take IFA for the recommended period. Thus, promoting recommended ANC visits, enhancing the quality of nutritional counseling, strengthening the expansion of media, and educate rural women towards the importance of optimal intake of IFA during pregnancy. Besides, the policymakers should design essential strategies based on identified barriers to improve the IFA intake for the recommended period.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
34330087,ARTS: A novel In-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis for the older adult brain.,"Brain arteriolosclerosis, one of the main pathologies of cerebral small vessel disease, is common in older adults and has been linked to lower cognitive and motor function and higher odds of dementia. In spite of its frequency and associated morbidity, arteriolosclerosis can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to develop an in-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis based on brain MRI. First, an ex-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis was developed based on features related to white matter hyperintensities, diffusion anisotropy and demographics by applying machine learning to ex-vivo MRI and pathology data from 119 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS), two longitudinal cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented older adults. The ex-vivo classifier showed good performance in predicting the presence of arteriolosclerosis, with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC=0.78. The ex-vivo classifier was then translated to in-vivo based on available in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI data on the same participants. The in-vivo classifier was named ARTS (short for ARTerioloSclerosis), is fully automated, and provides a score linked to the likelihood a person suffers from arteriolosclerosis. The performance of ARTS in predicting the presence of arteriolosclerosis in-vivo was tested in a separate, 91% dementia-free group of 79 MAP/ROS participants and exhibited an AUC=0.79 in persons with antemortem intervals shorter than 2.4years. This level of performance in mostly non-demented older adults is notable considering that arteriolosclerosis can only be diagnosed at autopsy. The scan-rescan reproducibility of the ARTS score was excellent, with an intraclass correlation of 0.99, suggesting that application of ARTS in longitudinal studies may show high sensitivity in detecting small changes. Finally, higher ARTS scores in non-demented older adults were associated with greater decline in cognition two years after baseline MRI, especially in perceptual speed which has been linked to arteriolosclerosis and small vessel disease. This finding was shown in a separate group of 369 non-demented MAP/ROS participants and was validated in 72 non-demented Black participants of the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and also in 244 non-demented participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 and 3. The results of this work suggest that ARTS may have broad implications in the advancement of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of arteriolosclerosis.

IND500739467,"Revision of the Cales noacki species complex (Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea, Aphelinidae)","The genus Cales (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) includes 13 species worldwide, of which 10 form a highly morphologically uniform species complex with a native range in the Neotropical region. We recognize ten species previously attributed to a single Neotropical species, Cales noacki Howard, which in the strict sense is a species broadly disseminated to control woolly whitefly. A neotype is designated for C. noacki, and it is redescribed based on specimens molecularly determined to be conspecific with the neotype. Newly described species include: C. bicolor Mottern, n.sp., C. breviclava Mottern, n.sp., C. brevisensillum Mottern n.sp., C. curvigladius Mottern, n.sp., C. longiseta Mottern, n.sp., C. multisensillum Mottern n.sp., C. noyesi Mottern, n.sp., C. parvigladius Mottern, n.sp. and C. rosei Mottern, n.sp. Species are delimited based on a combination of morphological and molecular data (28S-D2 rDNA and COI). Additional specimens are included in the phylogenetic analyses and although these likely represent several new species, we lack sufficient specimen sampling to describe them at this time. Cales are highly morphologically conserved and character-poor, resulting in several cryptic species. A molecular phylogeny of the known Neotropical species based on 28S-D25 rDNA and a 390-bp segment of COI is included, and identification keys to males and females are provided.

IND604793137,"Re‐evolution of a morphological precursor of crypsis investment in the newly revised horned praying mantises (Insecta, Mantodea, Vatinae)","The Neotropical praying mantis tribe Vatini Stl is revised using total evidence phylogenetic analysis based on molecular and coded morphological data. The subfamily Vatinae is redefined to only include Neotropical taxa with the removal of distantly related African and Asian lineages. A new tribe is erected under Vatinae (Heterovatini trib.n.) for two unique genera with historically unstable taxonomic placement (Heterovates Saussure and Chopardiella Giglio-Tos). Phylogenetic results and morphology support the synonymy of three genera (Lobovates Deeleman-Reinhold, Phyllovates Kirby, and Hagiotata Saussure & Zehntner) and the validity of Chopardiella Giglio-Tos, Heterovates Saussure, Callivates Roy, Pseudovates Saussure, Vates Burmeister, and Zoolea Audinet Serville. A new genus (Alangularis gen.n.) is created for a former species of Vates with unique morphology and separate phylogenetic placement. All genera are redescribed based on external morphology and the male genital complex. A key to genera for Vatinae is provided with dorsal habitus images of representatives for each genus. A distinct pattern of correlated evolution of morphological characters linked to crypsis was uncovered. Cuticular leg lobes within single leg segments are evolving as sets, and serially homologous lobes appear simultaneously or in close succession. The posteroventral lobes in the apical position on thoracic femora appear to be the precursors to multiple positive rate shifts in the evolutionary accumulation of cryptic features. One shift occurred early in the evolution of Vatinae while the second occurred much later, after the loss and re-evolution of the posteroventral lobes in the apical position on thoracic femora, a violation of Dollo's law.

IND605427586,"Protein, fat, moisture and cooking yields from a U.S. study of retail beef cuts","Nutrient data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are an important resource for U.S. and international databases. To ensure that data for retail beef cuts in USDA's National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) are current, a comprehensive, nationwide, multi-phase study was conducted. Samples were collected and analyzed in three phases based on primal category. Using a statistically based sampling plan, 72 beef carcasses per phase were obtained with nationally representative quality and yield grades, genders and genetic types. Retail cuts were fabricated, cooked and dissected to obtain component weights. Nutrient values were determined by validated laboratories using quality assurance procedures. Full nutrient profiles were made available in SR (http://www.ars.usda.gov/nutrientdata). Results for 16 beef retail cuts were compared for cooking yield and protein, fat and moisture concentrations. For example, cooked fat levels differed among three roasted cuts and among three grilled cuts from chuck, rib and loin (p<0.01). Cooking yield for roasted ribeye (76%) was lower (p<0.001) than for grilled ribeye (83%) or for chuck eye grilled (80%) or roasted (84%). This study demonstrates the importance of maintaining data for a variety of retail beef cuts due to their unique properties and different cooking methods.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,references other data resource
IND605724905,Omics analysis of acetic acid tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Acetic acid is an inhibitor in industrial processes such as wine making and bioethanol production from cellulosic hydrolysate. It causes energy depletion, inhibition of metabolic enzyme activity, growth arrest and ethanol productivity losses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of the yeast responses to acetic acid stress is essential for improving acetic acid tolerance and ethanol production. Although 329 genes associated with acetic acid tolerance have been identified in the Saccharomyces genome and included in the database (http://www.yeastgenome.org/observable/resistance_to_acetic_acid/overview), the cellular mechanistic responses to acetic acid remain unclear in this organism. Post-genomic approaches such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and chemogenomics are being applied to yeast and are providing insight into the mechanisms and interactions of genes, proteins and other components that together determine complex quantitative phenotypic traits such as acetic acid tolerance. This review focuses on these omics approaches in the response to acetic acid in S. cerevisiae. Additionally, several novel strains with improved acetic acid tolerance have been engineered by modifying key genes, and the application of these strains and recently acquired knowledge to industrial processes is also discussed.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
IND605743169,Estimating Thermodynamic Properties of Pure Triglyceride Systems Using the Triglyceride Property Calculator,"To date, the most comprehensive model for predicting thermodynamic properties of pure triglycerides was presented by Wesdorp in <U+0080><U+009C>Liquid-multiple solid phase equilibria in fats: theory and experiments<U+0080> (1990). In this paper, we present (1) corrections to the published model, as well as (2) a software implementation of the model for numerical assessment. The software tool, Triglyceride Property Calculator (TPC), uses a semi-empirical model to estimate the enthalpy of fusion and melting temperature for a given triglyceride based on its molecular composition and polymorphic form. These estimates are compared to experimentally collected data when available. The web application is available at http://www.crcfoodandhealth.com (under research tools) and through the AOCS Lipid Library. The quality of estimates is characterized according to defined counting metrics and presented for TAG subcategories. Additionally, the extrapolative value of the TPC is assessed by checking for consistency with underlying thermodynamic constraints. The current TPC implementation is effective in describing experimentally collected melting point data, with greater than 91% of the fitted values falling within 10% of the actual data. The TPC is also very good at describing collected enthalpy data. The underlying semi-empirical model and parameter set perform well in ensuring enthalpy predictions are thermodynamically consistent, however, extrapolated melting temperatures appear unreliable. Developing models and parameter sets that ensure thermodynamic consistency is a priority with future TPC iterations.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
IND605918011,Genetic diversity of endangered orchid Phaius australis across a fragmented Australian landscape,"Historical events such as colonisation, spatial distribution across different habitats, and contemporary processes, such as human-mediated habitat fragmentation can leave lasting imprints on the population genetics of a species. Orchids currently comprise 17% of threatened flora species in Australia (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) due to the combination of fragmentation and illegal harvesting (Benwell in Recovery plan, swamp orchids Phaius australis, Phaius tancarvilliae, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Sydney, 1994; Jones in A complete guide to native orchids of Australia including the island territories, 2ndedn, Reed Natural History, Sydney, 2006; DE in Phaius australis in species profile and threats database, Department of the Environment. http://www.environment.gov.au/sprat , 2015). The federally endangered Swamp Orchid Phaius australis has a disjunct distribution across an almost 2000km latitudinal range along Australias east coast but it was estimated that 95% of the populations have been lost since European settlement (Benwell 1994). Phaius australis is endangered due to illegal collection and habitat loss that has resulted in limited connectivity between populations, in ecosystems that are vulnerable to climate change. Thus the genetic impacts of its history combined with more recent fragmentation may have impacts on its future viability especially in light of changing environmental conditions. Thirty-four populations were sampled from tropical north Queensland to the southern edge of the subtropics in New South Wales. Population genetics analysis was conducted using 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers developed for the species using NextGen sequencing. Spatial genetic patterns indicate post-colonisation divergence from the tropics southwards to its current climate niche limits. Genetic diversity is low across all populations (A = 1.5, H <U+2091> =0.171), and there is little evidence of genetic differentiation between regions. Consistent with population genetic theory, the historic loss of populations has resulted in significantly lower genetic diversity in small populations compared to large (P, A, He; p < 0.05). The viability and persistence of P. australis populations now and in a changing climate are discussed in the context of conservation priorities.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
IND606427025,First Report of Sugarcane Yellow Leaf Disease in Mexico and Detection of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’-Related Strains in Affected Plants,"Sugarcane is a common name for any of several tall perennial grass species of the genus Saccharum. As a major source for sugar production and an efficient feedstock for biofuel generation, sugarcane is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. Mexico alone produces over six million metric tons of cane sugar annually valued at 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. Although economically important, sugarcane is susceptible to devastating diseases caused by phloem-colonizing, cell wall-less bacteria known as phytoplasmas. Different sugarcane phytoplasmal diseases around the world have been attributed to diverse phytoplasmas belonging to six mutually distinct Candidatus Phytoplasma species (Marcone 2002). During the 2015 to 2016 growing season, sugarcane plants exhibiting leaf discolorations (white and yellow streaks) indicative of sugarcane yellow leaf (ScYL) disease were observed in a sugarcane field in Cosamaloapan, Veracruz, Mexico, with less than 1% of the plants in the field being affected. Leaf samples were collected from three symptomatic and three asymptomatic plants in the same field. Total DNA was extracted from leaf midribs using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method (Perez-Lopez et al. 2016). A preliminary diagnostic assay was carried out using direct polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) with phytoplasma-specific primer pair R16F2n/R16R2. All PCR assays with DNA templates from symptomatic plants produced a phytoplasma-characteristic amplicon of 1.25 kb. No amplicon was detected from samples of asymptomatic plants. The DNA samples from symptomatic plants were subjected to further PCR analysis with primer pair P1A/16S-SR as previously described (Wei et al. 2011). All three samples were PCR positive, and each yielded a 1,539-bp amplicon. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced with at least 6 coverage per base position. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the amplicon represented a near-full-length 16S rRNA gene and a partial 16S-23S RNA gene intergenic spacer. The obtained DNA sequences were deposited into GenBank (accession nos. MH891144 through MH891146). Analysis of the sequences through the iPhyClassifier (Zhao et al. 2009, https://plantpathology.ba.ars.usda.gov/cgi-bin/resource/iphyclassifier.cgi) revealed that the phytoplasmas detected in the ScYL-diseased plants were closely related to the reference strain of Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris (aster yellows phytoplasma, >99.4% sequence similarity). Although the three 16S rRNA gene sequences differed from each other by two to five bases, all possessed the entire set of signature sequences (G196GGAGGA202, C444TGACGGTACC454, and C976ACAGTGGA GGTTATCAGTTG996) of Ca. P. asteris (Lee et al. 2004), indicating the three ScYL phytoplasma strains are sequevars (Davis et al. 2015) affiliated with a single phytoplasma species. To our knowledge, this is the first report of phytoplasmal ScYL disease in Mexico. Associations of aster yellows phytoplasma with sugarcane diseases were previously reported in Cuba and Brazil (Arocha et al. 1999; Silva et al. 2009). Recently, infection of aster yellows phytoplasma in weedy grass growing near sugarcane fields in Mexico was noted (Perez-Lopez and Dumonceaux 2017). Findings of aster yellows phytoplasma infecting sugarcane in the countries of Brazil, Cuba, and now Mexico (this report) underscore the need for disease surveillance of sugarcane in neighboring countries, because insect vectors capable of spreading aster yellows phytoplasma strains are known to be present over wide areas, including the Caribbean countries and the United States.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
IND606755271,Visual features based automated identification of fish species using deep convolutional neural networks,"Morphological based fish species identification is an erroneous and time-consuming process. There are numerous fish species and due to their close resemblance with each other, it is difficult to classify them by external characters. Recently, computer vision and deep learning-based identification of different animal species is being widely used by the researchers. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most analytically powerful tools in deep learning architecture for the image classification based on visual features. This work aims to propose a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species identification. The proposed CNN architecture contains 32 deep layers that are considerably deep to derive valuable and discriminating features from the image. The deep supervision is inflicted on the VGGNet architecture to increase the classification performance by instantly adding four convolutional layers to the training of each level in the network. To test the performance of proposed 32-Layer CNN architecture, we developed a dataset termed as Fish-Pak and is publicly available at Mendeley data (Fish-Pak: https://doi.org/10.17632/n3ydw29sbz.3#folder-6b024354-bae3-460a-a758-352685ba0e38). Fish-Pak contains 915 images with six distinct classes; Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass carp), Cyprinus carpio (Common carp), Cirrhinus mrigala (Mori), Labeo rohita (Rohu), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver carp), and Catla catla (Thala) and three different image views (head region, body shape, and scale). To ensure the superior performance of proposed CNN architecture, we have carried out the experimental comparison with other deep learning frameworks involving VGG-16 for transfer learning, one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50 on the Fish-Pak data set. Comprehensive empirical analyses reveal that the proposed method achieves state of the art performance and outperforms existing methods.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,mendley data
IND606827856,Occurrence of the Stunt Nematode Neodolichorhynchus sulcatus as Pathogen of Pepper (Capsicum annuum) in Israel,"Stunt nematodes, family Dolichodoridae, are migratory ectoparasites of roots. They feed on epidermal cells by inserting only the stylet tip into the cells surface tissue. As one of the less common stunt nematodes, little is known about Neodolichorhynchus sulcatus (de Guiran, 1967) Jairajpuri & Hunt, 1984. To date, it has been reported from Morocco (de Guiran 1967), Spain (Tobar-Jimenez 1970), Cameroon (Sakwe and Geraert 1991), India (Sultan et al. 1995), and Iran (Pourjam et al. 2011). This is the first detection of N. sulcatus infecting pepper (variety 1204 Alef Beit Zeraim) root from a farm in Ein Yahav, Arava Rift, Israel (3039'54.3''N, 3515'02.9''E). In March 2019, we observed decline in development of pepper plants. We recovered nematodes from the pepper root zone at high population density. Nematodes were extracted from the soil using the Baermann tray technique. Identification was based on a combination of molecular and morphological methods. Genomic DNA was extracted from a single fresh nematode; amplicons from 18S rRNA, 28S D2 to D3 rRNA, and the intergenic spacer (ITS) region were generated following the procedure detailed in Qing et al. (2019); and sequencing was performed. The sequences were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers MK96525 to MK965256 (28S), MK965252 (18S), and MK965249 and MK965250 (ITS), providing the first rRNA data for N. sulcatus. Phylogenetic analysis placed this species as sister to Bitylenchus iphilus in 18S (98.15% similar in BLAST), sister to Paratrophurus bhutanensis in 28S (91.68% similar in BLAST), or sister to a well-supported clade containing B. iphilus (91.35% similar in BLAST, highest match), B. maximus, B. hispaniensis, P. bhutanensis, and P. bursifer in ITS (figures for phylogeny trees available at https://photos.app.goo.gl/2Y7fToEftBopbnB67). Although our species were not clustered with other Neodolichorhynchus species, morphology and morphometry confirmed its identity as N. sulcatus, including the cephalic region offset, basal bulb pyriform, a cuticle with 16 longitudinal ridges including the lateral fields, irregularly areolated lateral fields with three ridges, bursa not notched at tail tip, gubernaculum with smooth proximal end, and vulva lacking lateral flaps, tail cylindroid-conical with rounded and smooth terminus. Measurements (mean  standard error, range, in m) for female (n = 10): body length 801  49.4 (731 to 901), anterior end to vulva 435  34.8 (410 to 520), V value 54.2  1.69 (52.4 to 57.7), lip height 4.53  0.31 (4.39 to 5.41), stylet length 21.4  0.37 (20.6 to 21.8), cone of stylet 11.4  0.63 (10.7 to 12.8), anterior end to center of median bulb 86.0  3.53 (78.7 to 91.3), pharynx length 146  4.05 (139 to 153), maximum body width 25.6  1.00 (24 to 27), anus/cloacal width 15.7  1.39 (14.3 to 17.9), tail length 47.2  3.85 (43.4 to 56.5); for male (n = 7): body length 786  64.0 (704 to 874), lip height 4.34  0.55 (3.67 to 5.24), stylet length 20.4  0.73 (19.7 to 21.7), cone of stylet 10.9  0.82 (10.3 to 12.7), anterior end to median bulb 81.2  3.54 (75.2 to 87), pharynx length 138  6.66 (132 to 148), maximum body width 22.6  2.15 (20.4 to 25.8), anus/cloacal width 17.7  1.50 (15.2 to 19.9), tail length 54.7  5.67 (46.6 to 62.6), spicule length 26.3  1.21 (24.2 to 27.6). To confirm pathogenicity, we performed inoculation assays in greenhouse conditions. Individual nematodes were manually picked, and 300 juveniles were inoculated onto healthy pepper (variety Maccabi) roots growing in sterile soil in a greenhouse. Three pots with four pepper plants per pot were inoculated, and three noninoculated pots served as a control. Nematodes were harvested from the root and soil 40 days after inoculation, yielding an average of 483  75 nematodes per pot. We observed a reduction in plant growth and necrotic spots on the roots similar to those infected pepper in Ein Yahav. These results confirmed the nematodes pathogenicity to pepper. This is the first report of N. sulcatus infecting pepper plants in Israel.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
IND607322953,First Report of Grapevine Red Globe Virus in Grapevines in Washington State,"Grapevine red globe virus (GRGV; genus Maculavirus, family Tymoviridae) has been reported in grapevines (Vitis spp.) from Italy, Greece, France, China, Spain, and Germany and in California, U.S.A. (Cretazzo et al. 2017; Fan et al. 2016; Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2018; Sabanadzovic et al. 2000). During surveys of grapevine nurseries, a total of 241 composite samples, each consisting of four petioles from mature leaves/vine from five asymptomatic grapevines, from 33 grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cultivars were collected. Total RNA isolated from these samples using a Spectrum Total RNA isolation kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was subjected to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on an Illumina HiSeq2500 or NovaSeq 6000 platform in paired-end mode (Genomics Core Facility, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Utah University, Salt Lake City, UT). After trimming raw reads based on quality and ambiguity, the paired-end quality reads of approximately 120 (HiSeq) or 145 (NovaSeq) base pair (bp) length were assembled de novo into a pool of contigs (CLC Genomics Workbench 12). These contigs were subjected to BLASTn analysis against the nonredundant virus database from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). A total of 49 contig sequences, ranging from 200 to 1,645 bp in length with an average coverage ranging up to 418.7, aligning with GRGV genome, were detected in cultivars Aglianico, Cabernet franc, Pinot gris, and Riesling. BLASTn analysis of contigs greater than 500 bp in length showed sequence identity between 88.5 and 95% with corresponding GRGV sequences reported from other countries. These results indicated the presence of genetically distinct isolates of GRGV. HTS data also revealed coinfection of GRGV in all samples with one or more of the following viruses and/or viroids: grapevine rupestris stem pitting associated virus, grapevine rupestris vein feathering virus, hop stunt viroid, or grapevine yellow speckle viroid-1. To further confirm infection by GRGV, total RNA was extracted from two asymptomatic Pinot gris vines that previously tested positive in HTS using the Spectrum Total RNA isolation kit and subjected to reverse transcription PCR using primers specific to the replicase polyprotein gene of the virus (RG4847F, 5'-TGGTCTGTTGTTCGCATCTT-3'; RG6076R, 5' CGGAAGGGGAAGCATTGATCT-3' Cretazzo et al. 2017). Sequence analysis of the approximately 1,250-bp amplicons (accession no. MT749359) showed 91.2% nt sequence identity with a corresponding sequence of GRGV isolate from Brazil (KX828704.1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of GRGV in Washington State. Together with the report of the occurrence of GRGV in California (Sabanadzovic et al. 2000), these results indicate wide geographical distribution of the virus. Although GRGV can cause asymptomatic infections in grapevines (Martelli et al. 2002), the economic importance of GRGV as single or coinfections with other viruses needs to be examined to assess the potential significance of the virus to grape production and grapevine certification programs.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

PMC3498971,"BioNetwork Bench: Database and Software for Storage, Query, and Analysis of Gene and Protein Networks","Gene and protein networks offer a powerful approach for integration of the disparate yet complimentary types of data that result from high-throughput analyses. Although many tools and databases are currently available for accessing such data, they are left unutilized by bench scientists as they generally lack features for effective analysis and integration of both public and private datasets and do not offer an intuitive interface for use by scientists with limited computational expertise. We describe BioNetwork Bench, an open source, user-friendly suite of database and software tools for constructing, querying, and analyzing gene and protein network models. It enables biologists to analyze public as well as private gene expression; interactively query gene expression datasets; integrate data from multiple networks; store and selectively share the data and results. Finally, we describe an application of BioNetwork Bench to the assembly and iterative expansion of a gene network that controls the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors. The tool is available from http://bionetworkbench.sourceforge.net/ Background The emergence of high-throughput technologies has allowed many biological investigators to collect a great deal of information about the behavior of genes and gene products over time or during a particular disease state. Gene and protein networks offer a powerful approach for integration of the disparate yet complimentary types of data that result from such high-throughput analyses. There are a growing number of public databases, as well as tools for visualization and analysis of networks. However, such databases and tools have yet to be widely utilized by bench scientists, as they generally lack features for effective analysis and integration of both public and private datasets and do not offer an intuitive interface for use by biological scientists with limited computational expertise. Results We describe BioNetwork Bench, an open source, user-friendly suite of database and software tools for constructing, querying, and analyzing gene and protein network models. BioNetwork Bench currently supports a broad class of gene and protein network models (eg, weighted and un-weighted, undirected graphs, multi-graphs). It enables biologists to analyze public as well as private gene expression, macromolecular interaction and annotation data; interactively query gene expression datasets; integrate data from multiple networks; query multiple networks for interactions of interest; store and selectively share the data as well as results of analyses. BioNetwork Bench is implemented as a plug-in for, and hence is fully interoperable with, Cytoscape, a popular open-source software suite for visualizing macromolecular interaction networks. Finally, we describe an application of BioNetwork Bench to the problem of assembly and iterative expansion of a gene network that controls the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors. Conclusions BioNetwork Bench provides a suite of open source software for construction, querying, and selective sharing of gene and protein networks. Although initially aimed at a community of biologists interested in retinal development, the tool can be adapted easily to work with other biological systems simply by populating the associated database with the relevant datasets.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,no new data or value add?
PMC3788421,PS3-52: Heart Health in Your Pocket: Lessons Learned from the Development of a Smartphone App,"<h4>Background/Aims</h4> As part of the Million Hearts national initiative to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), there are increasing calls to leverage health information technology. The Marshfield Clinic developed a Heart Health Mobile application (app) that is designed to improve awareness of CVD risk and promote risk factor control among regional smartphone users. It deploys an engaging user interface that provides a brief CVD risk assessment that takes into account self-reported behavioral, familial, and biometric risk factors, including blood pressure and lipids. Users are then directed to nearby community pharmacies, clinics, and other locations where more advanced CVD risk factor screenings can be obtained. Along with social media connections and measurement prompts, basic education materials are provided on key CVD prevention topics such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, weight management, and tobacco cessation. <h4>Methods</h4> A multidisciplinary team of 24 members was created to develop the app over a 30-day timeframe. This team included a broad cross-section of clinical professionals from medicine, epidemiology, health IT, usability and graphic designers, business analytics, and marketing. An Agile programming method was used to promote adaptive planning and evolutionary development in self-organizing, cross-functional teams. <h4>Results</h4> The iOS app was successfully developed, tested, and launched within the 30-day timeframe. It was submitted competitively as part of the Million Hearts Risk Check Challenge, a CVD prevention app contest sponsored by Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. The final product is shown in detail at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfESTQipjtw.

THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS BETWEEN RENAMING SCHIZOPHRENIA AND VISITING FREQUENCY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BY BIG DATA ANALYSIS (INTERNET SEARCHES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES) IN SOUTH KOREA,"Abstract <h4>Background</h4> Korean Neuropsychiatric Association changed the Korean term for schizophrenia from split-mind disorder to attunement disorder in 2012, to dispel the stigma associated with name, and to promote early detection and treatment. Information on the internet affects the public awareness and attitude toward schizophrenia. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between renaming schizophrenia and the pattern of mental health services utilization by big data analysis of internet (newspaper articles and internet searches) in Korea. <h4>Methods</h4> From January 2016 to September 2017, newspaper articles on attunement disorder and split-mind disorder available on the internet were classified as related with negative images like crime and helpful or positive in dispelling the stigma. The relationship between the number of anti-stigma newspaper articles and newspaper articles of schizophrenia containing both positive and negative images was examined. In addition, using Naver, a major internet search engine in Korea, we investigated the total number of internet searches of both old and new name of schizophrenia by gender differences. Finally, the frequency of the visits of mental health services of patients with schizophrenia was measured using the Korean Healthcare Bigdata Hub (http://opendata.hira.or.kr/home.do#none) for 14 months and the correlation between the frequency of the visits and the above big data was examined. The data were analyzed using the SPSS/WIN 24.0. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to analyze correlations. <h4>Results</h4> The amounts of newspaper articles containing anti-stigma of schizophrenia were correlated with the amounts of newspaper articles containing negative images like crime of the new name (attunement disorder) of schizophrenia (r=0.528, p<0.01), which was greater than the amounts of newspaper articles containing the old name (split-mind disorder) of schizophrenia (r=0.300, p<0.01). We also found that a strong positive correlation between the number of articles about attunement disorder and search frequency about the term on the internet. In addition, the search frequency was more highly related to the number of articles containing negative images of the illness (e.g., related crimes, r = 0.910, p<0.01) than that of articles providing positive aspects of the illness (e.g., dispelling stigma, r = 0.423, p<0.01). There was no significant correlation between the number of schizophrenia-related newspaper articles in previous month and the visits of mental health services of patients with schizophrenia in next month. There were no gender differences in internet searches. The correlation between the internet search frequency for attunement disorder in the previous month and the visits of the mental health services of patients with schizophrenia (r = 0.185, p>0.05) in next month was larger than the correlation of split-mind disorder searches with mental health services utilization (r = 0.082, p>0.05). <h4>Discussion</h4> Attunement disorder rather than split-mind disorder was appeared more frequently in newspaper articles of the anti-stigma characteristics. Attunement disorder seems to be more useful for anti-stigma campaign. Renaming schizophrenia didnt seem to affect the visiting frequency of mental health services. There was statistical limitation which was originated from the lack of numbers of patients information. It was because Korean Bigdata Hub provided patients information just for 14 months as monthly data. Also, it should be considered that the time period, the kinds of mental disorders and the search engine we investigated were limited. Future research needs to overcome these limitations.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

IMPLEMENTATION OF METHYLATION PROFILING FOR CNS TUMOR DIAGNOSIS IN THE PRINCESS MÁXIMA CENTER FOR PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY, THE NETHERLANDS","Abstract <h4>BACKGROUND</h4> Since the fall of 2016, in the Netherlands diagnosis and treatment of children with CNS tumors is increasingly concentrated in the Princess Mxima Center (PMC), i.e. the newly established, national center for pediatric oncology. Because of its potential as a support tool for CNS tumor diagnosis, Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip analysis was readily implemented and routinely performed on pediatric CNS tumor samples in the PMC. AIM: To identify the challenges and opportunities of methylation profiling as a support tool for the diagnosis of pediatric CNS tumors. PATIENTS AND <h4>METHODS</h4> We have now analyzed >150 pediatric (formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded) CNS tumor samples using methylation profiling and matched the profiles with the Heidelberg database (https://www.molecularneuropathology.org/mnp). <h4>RESULTS</h4> In > 90% of analyzed cases, the suggested methylation class corresponded very well with the pathological (histological +/- molecular) diagnosis. In some other cases, the suggested methylation class was not very helpful because the reliability score of the test was (too) low, or because the suggested class not adequately reflected the actual presence of a tumor (e.g. reactive/inflammatory changes) or was not (yet) as precise as desired (e.g. diffuse glioma/glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, midline type (but not H3-mutant)). However, in many other cases the tool was very helpful for reaching a more precise diagnosis (esp. so for medulloblastomas, ependymomas) or directed towards the right diagnosis. <h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4> Methylation profiling is a very powerful tool to confirm, fine-tune and/or direct pediatric CNS tumor diagnostics. However, it is crucial to interpret this new level of information in the clinical, radiological and pathological context.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,not about the resource
PMC6666521,PSIII-22 Performance of DNA 600 Duroc sired pigs when split sex fed with commercial diets with or without a blend of phytonutrients (Lean Fuel),"Abstract The objective was to evaluate the effect of a blend of phytonutrients (Lean Fuel, LF) on performance of pigs in late finishing in a commercial research barn. A total of 590 DNA 600 Duroc finishing pigs (BW=75.7 + 1.0 kg) were blocked by weight and sex and allocated across two dietary treatments with 6 replications per treatment and 21 to 26 pigs per pen. Dietary treatments were: barrow (B) diets with and without LF and gilt (G) diets with and without LF. Diets were formulated to split-sex requirements (CON) for each period and LF diets were control diets + 0.125% LF. The experiment was 44-d where d 0 was 98-d post-wean. All data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS as a randomized complete block design as a 2 x 2 (diet x sex) factorial arrangement. Pen served as the experimental unit. Overall (d 0-44), the B gained more weight (P = 0.0282) and consumed more feed (P > 0.10) in ADFI. There was no diet x sex interaction (P > 0.10) for ADG. There was a tendency for an interaction (P = 0.0545) for ADFI, where LF B consumed more feed compared to CON B and CON G consumed more feed compared to LF G. There was an interaction for G:F (P = 0.0028) where G on LF had higher G:F compared to G on CON whereas G:F for B was not different to B on LF. In conclusion, LF improved ADG and G:F, but did so differently for G and B.  http://www.conferenceharvester.com/","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,
PMC6666854,"PSIV-13 Basal endogenous loss, standardized total tract digestibility, and retention of Ca in sows change throughout gestation, but microbial phytase reduces basal endogenous loss of Ca by gestating sows","Abstract The objective was to test the hypothesis that standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of Ca and Ca and P retention and the response to microbial phytase in diets fed to sows are constant throughout gestation. Thirty-six sows (parity = 3.3) were allotted to 4 diets on d 7 post-breeding. Two corn-based diets in which calcium carbonate was the sole source of Ca and 2 Ca-free diets were formulated without or with phytase (500 units per kg). Sows were housed individually in metabolism crates during early-gestation, mid-gestation, and late-gestation, and feces and urine were quantitatively collected. Data were analyzed by repeated measures using a model that included phytase, period of gestation, and the interaction between phytase and period as fixed effects, and block and replicate as random effects. Interactions between period and phytase were not observed. The basal endogenous loss (BEL) of Ca was greater (P < 0.05) in early-gestation than in mid- and late-gestation, but phytase reduced (P = 0.002) BEL of Ca and tended (P = 0.099) to increase apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P in the Ca-free diet. Phytase did not affect ATTD of DM, STTD of Ca, ATTD of P, or Ca and P retention in sows fed the diet containing calcium carbonate (Table 1). The ATTD of DM was not affected by period, but Ca retention and ATTD of Ca and P were least (P < 0.05) in mid-gestation, followed by early- and late-gestation, and the STTD of Ca in mid-gestation was also reduced (P < 0.05) compared with early- or late-gestation. Phosphorus retention was greater (P < 0.05) in late-gestation than in the earlier periods. In conclusion, BEL of Ca, STTD of Ca, ATTD of P, and Ca and P retention in sows change throughout gestation regardless of use of phytase.  http://www.conferenceharvester.com/","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0,,

Describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV care in Latin America,"Abstract <h4>Background</h4> The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with HIV (PWH) are unknown. Beyond SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, the pandemic may have devastating consequences for HIV care delivery. Understanding these is crucial as reduced antiretroviral therapy (ART) availability alone could lead to =500,000 AIDS-related deaths in 20202021. With Latin America now a focal point in the pandemic, we sought to describe the impact of COVID-19 on HIV care at Latin American clinical sites. <h4>Methods</h4> Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) and additional Brazilian HIV care sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru were included. An electronic survey of COVID-19 effects on HIV clinic operations was administered in Spanish or English via phone and email, April 28-June 2, 2020. We also compared national COVID-19 case, mortality, and policy data from public sources. <h4>Results</h4> Brazils and Mexicos epidemics appear most pronounced, with >10,000 confirmed COVID-19-related deaths (Figure 1); countries implemented social distancing policies at different times after initial cases, with Haiti earliest and Mexico latest (Figure 2). Nearly all 13 sites reported decreased hours and providers for HIV care. Twelve of 13 reported increased use of telehealth, suspension/postponements of routine HIV appointments, and/or suspension of HIV research. Eleven of 13 reported initiation of new COVID-19 research but suspension of community HIV testing, and nearly half provided additional ART supplies. Nearly 70% reported impacts on HIV viral load testing and nearly 40% reported personal protective equipment stock-outs (Table). All 13 sites experienced changes in resources/services in tandem with national policies; there was wide variation, however, in the number of economic and health supports implemented thus far (e.g., quarantines, tax deferrals, interest rate reductions, etc.), from 172 COVID-19-related policies in Brazil to only 30 in Mexico.

PMC7989604,"112 Outcomes and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Disease in the Frail, Elderly Population of Tayside","Abstract <h4>Introduction</h4> With advancing age, frailty, multi-morbidity and need for care, elderly patients are some of the most vulnerable to Covid-19 disease. In NHS Tayside, a dedicated Covid-19 Medicine for the Elderly (MFE) Team was formed to care for patients identified as frail and likely to benefit from comprehensive geriatric assessment. <h4>Methods</h4> All Covid-19 patients meeting frailty criteria1, cared for by the Covid-19 MFE Team were identified. Data on outcomes and clinical characteristics for all (140) patients admitted during the first pandemic wave (MarchJuly 2020) was collected using electronic patient records and analysed. <h4>Results</h4> Patients were predominantly male (58.6%). Ages ranged from 6599years, with 43.6% aged =85years. 82.1% had one or more of cough, fever and anosmia on admission fitting Covid-19 case definition 2. Lymphopenia was present in 92.1%. Of note, 26.5% of patients had a normal or unchanged chest x-ray report, with only 10.2% showing bilateral peripheral infiltrates. 28-day mortality was 37.1% with Covid-19 Disease listed as primary cause of death in 90.4%. <h4>Conclusion(s)</h4> Entering further waves of infection, it is vital that we understand the clinical presentation and course of Covid-19 disease in elderly patients. Our data highlights that any Covid-19 symptom, even in isolation, should raise suspicion of disease. Chest x-rays should not be used alone as a diagnostic tool. The presence of lymphopenia should raise suspicion of Covid-19 infection. In developing an understanding of how elderly patients with Covid-19 present, we can ensure early identification and initiation of appropriate infection control measures. <h4>References</h4> 1.

PMC8054692,"A Spatial Web Application to Explore the Interactions between Human Mobility, Government Policies, and COVID-19 Cases","Reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases began in December 2019. Soon after, the virus had spread around the world and became a pandemic. Social restrictions, quarantines, and other governmental policies in response to the pandemic altered normal operations across the world. One area significantly affected is human mobility. Typical movement patterns have been hindered by the pandemic. But inversely, mobility patterns can influence patterns of the virus. With this in mind, we created an interactive web application to visualize in near-real time the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and human mobility, as well as the impact of governmental policies at different spatial scales. The web application allows users to select a country at the global scale or a state or county for the USA and then displays a corresponding plot that compares human mobility to COVID-19 cases across time for the location, as well as to policy data. The application is useful for quickly revealing insightful patterns. First, the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a rather sudden decrease in mobility. Second, a relationship exists between mobility and COVID-19 offset by a lag, but that lag is not consistent over space or time. Third, spatial autocorrelation of relationship is apparent, meaning locations near each other share similar patterns. Overall, the application is a useful data visualization tool that helps uncover patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

PMC8090191,Study of Patients’ Characteristics and Mutual Impact Between Covid-19 and Hyperglycemia at a Community Hospital in Central Brooklyn,"Abstract Background: Studies have shown that poorly-controlled hyperglycemia worsens the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (C-19) and C-19 may damage pancreatic islets via ACE2 receptors causing acute hyperglycemia. The major population we serve at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) are underprivileged with many of them having multiple comorbidities. Methods: This is a retrospective study wherein patients, admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 with hyperglycemia, were selected and divided into 2 groups based on presence or absence of C-19. Data include demographics, comorbidities, blood glucose level, serum osmolality, serum bicarbonate, anion gap, acute kidney injury (AKI), serum creatinine, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Data were analyzed using descriptive study and T-test. Results: 100 patients were included in the C-19 group (CG) and 88 patients were included in the Non C-19 group (NCG). Major comorbidities were similar in both groups including HTN, DM, CKD followed by ESRD. Mean age of patients (years) was 65.68 in CG and 61.17 in NCG. 61% were male in CG and 53.41% were male in NCG. 16% and 9% developed DKA and HHS in CG, and 13.64% and 6.82% developed DKA and HHS in NCG respectively. 15% in CG had combined DKA & HHS and 3.41% had same in NCG. Mean blood glucose level (mg/dl) was 541.6 in CG and 460.0 in NCG (p=0.03). Mean serum osmolality (mOsm/kg) was 335.7 (SD41.01) in CG and 317.1 (SD30.54) in NCG (p=0.01). Mean serum bicarbonate (mEq/L) was 17.73 (SD6.31) in CG and 21.46 (SD5.94) in NCG (p<0.0001). Mean anion gap was 17.93 (SD7.6) in CG and 13.10 (SD7.2) in NCG (p<0.0001). 56% in CG and 37% in NCG developed AKI respectively (p=0.01). Mean serum creatinine (mg/dl) was 4.22 in CG and 1.65 in NCG (p=0.004). 55% of CG were admitted to ICU and 34% of NCG were admitted to ICU (p=0.003). Median LOS (days) in discharged patients was 8 in CG and 5 in NCG (p=0.02). Mortality was 40% in CG and 3.41% in NCG (p<0.0001). 12 patients in CG and 2 patients in NCG developed new-onset diabetes. In the subset of DKA, interestingly, mean age (years) was 61.63 (SD17.73) in CG and 39.67 in NCG (SD13.39) (p=0.001). Conclusion: In our study, patients in the CG carry worse laboratory parameters, unfavorable clinical outcomes and strikingly higher mortality. We discovered increased incidence of new-onset diabetes and elderly DKA in CG. In an inner city population like ours, the burden of DM with significant social and health care disparities is quite severe. Diabetic patients with concurrent C-19 infection can have particularly negative outcomes and C-19 possibly damages the pancreatic islets resulting in acute hyperglycemic crisis. Further research on larger population is required.
